**On Elementary Properties of a Multi-Dimensional Generalization of the Euclidean Algorithm** ([PDF](https://github.com/dknaack/master-thesis/releases/download/v1.0/main.pdf))

> In 1848, Charles Hermite posed the question of whether every real number admits
    a representation as a sequence of integers, periodic if and only if the number
    is a cubic irrational.
    While continued fractions solve this problem for
    quadratic irrationals, no analogous representation is known for higher-degree
    algebraic numbers.
    This thesis explores a new approach to Hermite’s question through the
    construction of multidimensional continued fractions (MDCFs), which extend ordinary
    continued fractions to higher dimensions using a generalization of the
    Euclidean algorithm.
>
> It is shown that most multidimensional continued fractions converge, and that
    any periodic fraction represents an algebraic number of bounded degree.
    These results establish one direction of Hermite’s question in higher
    dimensions.
    An experimental study complements the theoretical findings, providing
    numerical evidence that a wide class of algebraic numbers -- including many
    cube roots -- give rise to periodic MDCFs.
