\begin{problem}[Hermite's Question]
  Is there a representation of the real numbers as a sequence of integers such
  that the sequence is eventually periodic if and only if the real number is a
  cubic irrational?
\end{problem}

% TODO: Fix definition of eventually periodic
More formally, we are looking for a function which maps any real number $r$ to
a sequence $(a_n)_{n \in \N}$ such that $a_{k+n} = a_{\ell+n}$ for all $n \ge k$ and
some $k \ne \ell$ if and only if there is a cubic polynomial $p$ such that $p(r) = 0$.
Importantly, the function must map \emph{all} real numbers to a sequence.
Nadir Murru \cite{Murru15} has already shown that there exists a mapping from all
cubic irrationals to eventually periodic sequences.
However, the author was unable to derive a sequence for all real numbers.
