\chapter{Higher-Order Fibonacci Numbers and their Golden Ratios}
\label{ch:fibonacci}

% TODO: Add reference to Fibonacci numbers in the continued fraction chapter
One of the simplest periodic continued fraction is $[1; \overline{1}]$.
This fraction evaluates to the golden ratio and its convergents are ratios of
consecutive Fibonacci numbers.
Naturally, we can consider the simplest vectors $x ∈ ℝ^d$ for the generalized
Euclidean algorithm, where the integer part in each iteration is $1$.
Such vectors can be seen as a generalization of the golden
ratio to higher dimensions and their approximation can be seen as a
generalization of Fibonacci numbers.
However, there does not exist a single definitive golden ratio,
Since the generalized algorithm allows an additional freedom in the choice of the pivot.
So there are actually multiple different possible definitions.
Some of these are well known, like the supergolden ratio or the plastic ratio,
which are both roots of cubic polynomials.

Since the definition of the golden ratios depends entirely on the choice of our
pivot element $x_ℓ$, we consider two strategies for choosing $x_ℓ$ in this
chapter: First choosing the smallest fractional value $\{x_ℓ\}$ and second
choosing the largest fractional value $\{x_ℓ\}$.
Both of these strategies have a respective golden ratio for which the algorithm
becomes periodic and they each have a corresponding linear recurrence, which
can be seen as a generalization of the Fibonacci numbers.
In the end, we will derive a general definition of higher-order Fibonacci
sequences and show that the generalized Euclidean algorithm is periodic for
their golden ratios.

\section{The Classical Case: Fibonacci Numbers and the Golden Ratio}
% ==============================================================================

\begin{definition}
  The \emph{Fibonacci numbers} are defined as
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item $F(0) = F(1) = 1$.
    \item $F(n) = F(n - 1) + F(n - 2)$ for $n > 2$.
  \end{enumerate}
\end{definition}

We revisit the classical case of Fibonacci numbers and the golden ratio
to analyze their relationship with the Euclidean algorithm.
The analysis of the running time of the Euclidean algorithm was actually one of
the first practical applications of the Fibonacci numbers.
They show up in a proof by Lamé, who he bounded the number of iterations by the
number of digits in the input.
The proof is considered by some \cite{TODO} as the beginning of computational
complexity theory.

\begin{theorem}[Lamé's Theorem \cite{Lame44}]
  \label{thm:lame}
  The Euclidean algorithm requires at most $5h$ steps,
  where $h = \log_{10}(b)$.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
  % TODO
\end{proof}

The theorem also follows easily using the continued fraction of the ratios
between Fibonacci numbers.
Given a finite continued fraction $[a₀; a₁, …, a_n]$, the Euclidean algorithm
requires $n$ steps for any input $(a, b)$ with the same ratio $a/b$ as the
continued fraction.
Since $[1; 1, …, 1] = F(n+1)/F(n)$ for some $n ≥ 0$, the Euclidean algorithm
takes at least $n$ steps for two consecutive Fibonacci numbers.
Furthermore, Fibonacci numbers are the smallest numbers which require $n$ steps
since we can only increase the coefficients of the continued fraction.

What makes Fibonacci numbers special with respect to the Euclidean algorithm
is that the division at each step always has a quotient of $1$.

\begin{example}
  Consider $a = 13$ and $b = 8$.
  The algorithm proceeds as follows:
  \[
    \begin{array}{rclcrcl}
      13/8 & = & 1 & · & 5/8 & + & 3/8 \\
       5/8 & = & 1 & · & 3/8 & + & 2/8 \\
       3/8 & = & 1 & · & 2/8 & + & 1/8 \\
       2/8 & = & 2 & · & 1/8 & + & 0.
    \end{array}
  \]
\end{example}

\begin{theorem}
  $\lim_{n → ∞} \frac{F(n+1)}{F(n)} = φ$.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
  First, the continued fraction $[1; 1, …, 1]$ already evaluates to the ratio of consecutive Fibonacci numbers,
  since the numerator $p_n$ and the denominator $q_n$ are defined by the sequences:
  \[
    p_n = a_n p_{n-1} + p_{n-2}, q_n = a_n q_{n-1} + q_{n-2}
  \]
  and $a_n = 1$ for every $n ≥ 0$.
  Therefore, they are exactly the Fibonacci sequences and furthermore, $q_n$ starts one index behind $p_n$,
  which results in the ratios $F(n+1)/F(n)$.
  Lemma~\vref{lem:cf-approx} then gives us the convergence of the ratios towards some limit $L$.
  The limit $L$ must satisfy
  \[
    L = \lim_{n → ∞} \frac{F(n+1)}{F(n)} = \lim_{n → ∞} 1 + \frac{F(n-1)}{F(n)} = 1 + \frac{1}{L}.
  \]
  Multiplying this equation by $L$ gives the defining polynomial of the golden ratio $φ$
  and the ratios are always positive, so $L = φ$.
\end{proof}

\begin{example}
  Let $φ$ be the golden ratio,
  which satisfies $φ^2 - φ - 1 = 0$
  and has an approximate value of $1.618$.
  The algorithm proceeds as follows:
  \[
    \begin{array}{rclcrcl}
      φ & = & 1 & · & 1   & + & φ - 1 \\
         1 & = & 1 & · & (φ - 1) & + & (2 - φ) \\
       φ - 1 & = & 1 & · & (2 - φ) & + & (2φ - 3) \\
       2 - φ & = & 1 & · & (2φ - 3) & + & (5 - 3φ) \\
       & \vdots &
    \end{array}
  \]
\end{example}

In summary,
the defining property of Fibonacci numbers with respect to the Euclidean
algorithm is that they always have a quotient of $1$ in each iteration.
Furthermore, they are the smallest numbers which have this property.

\section{Higher-Order Fibonacci Numbers}
% ==============================================================================

% TODO: There should be a discussion on what it even means to have a Fibonacci number in higher dimensions
% TODO: We should also discuss the thing about idempotence under the choice of the pivot.
% TODO: Should we have a discussion about why we choose this particular linear system.

For the generalisation of Fibonacci numbers with respect to the generalized
Euclidean algorithm,
we must find a sequence which similarly has a quotient of $1$ at each iteration.
However, the problem is that no single definitive sequence can exist.
With the generalized Euclidean algorithm we have an additional choice with the
element we choose to pivot with.
Therefore, multiple different notions of Fibonacci numbers exist for this
algorithm.

In the generalized Euclidean algorithm,
the quotient comes from the solution vector $x$.
In fact, the execution of the algorithm depends entirely on this vector.
There are infinitely many possible linear systems which have the same solution vector $x$.
We use a simple construction, which
given a rational vector $x = \left(\frac{p₁}{q}, \frac{p₂}{q}, …, \frac{p_d}{q}\right)$,
constructs the linear system $Bx = c$ with
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:linear-system-construction}
  B =
  \begin{pmatrix}
    q & 0 & ⋯ & 0 \\
    0 & q & ⋯ & 0 \\
    ⋮ & ⋮ & ⋱ & ⋮ \\
    0 & 0 & ⋯ & q \\
  \end{pmatrix},
  \quad
  c =
  \begin{pmatrix}
    p₁ \\
    p₂ \\
    ⋮ \\
    p_d
  \end{pmatrix}.
\end{equation}
Therefore, we define the Fibonacci numbers in terms of the solution vector $x$
and use the construction of $B$ and $c$ as the input to the generalized
Euclidean algorithm.

  \centering
  \input{tables/min-fibonacci}
\end{table}

% I would like a better explanation of what the goal of this section is
We begin by deriving the Fibonacci numbers for one particular strategy.
Recall that the determinant decreases by $\{x_ℓ\}$ in each iteration.
So the first strategy one may think of is to choose the index $ℓ$ with the
smallest fractional value.
After all, this gives us the largest decrease in the determinant over one iteration.
Locally, this would be the highest decrease we can achieve.
So we begin with this strategy and see how the Fibonacci numbers are defined.

% TODO: Actually explain how we derive the Fibonacci numbers for this strategy.
% TODO: Should we have a table for the Fibonacci numbers?
% TODO: What about adding references to their OEIS number?

\begin{definition}
  The Fibonacci numbers for this strategy are defined as
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item $F(0) = F(1) = ⋯ = F(d) = 1$.
    \item $F(n + 1) = F(n) + F(n - 1) + ⋯ + F(n - d)$.
  \end{enumerate}
  For $d = 2, 3$ and $4$, they are also referred to as the Tribonacci, Tetranacci
  and Pentanacci numbers.
  In general, they are known as the $d$-bonacci numbers.
\end{definition}

For these numbers, we use the solution vector
\[
  x =
  \left(
    \frac{F(n)}{F(n + 1)},\;
    \frac{F(n) + F(n - 1)}{F(n + 1)},\;
    ⋯,\;
    \frac{F(n) + F(n - 1) + ⋯ + F(n + 1 - d)}{F(n + 1)}\;
  \right)
\]
and we can use the construction from Equation~\ref{eq:linear-system-construction}
for the actual input to the generalized Euclidean algorithm.

The smallest fractional value in this vector is $x₁$, so we pivot with $ℓ = 1$ first.
\begin{align*}
  \{x₁'\}
  & = \left\{\frac{1}{\{x₁\}}\right\}
  = \left\{\frac{F(n + 1)}{F(n)}\right\}
  = \frac{F(n - 1) + ⋯ + F(n - d)}{F(n)}.
\end{align*}
This gives us the value for $x_d$, if we would have started with $F(n)$ instead of $F(n+1)$.
The other values in our input vector $x$ are calculated as follows:
\begin{align*}
  \{xᵢ'\}
  & = \left\{\frac{\{xᵢ\}}{\{x₁\}}\right\} \\
  & = \left\{\frac{F(n) + F(n - 1) + ⋯ + F(n + 1 - i)}{F(n + 1)} · \frac{F(n + 1)}{F(n)}\right\} \\
  & = \frac{F(n - 1) + ⋯ + F(n - d)}{F(n)}.
\end{align*}
So in the next iteration the value $x_i$ has the same value as $x_{i+1}$ if we
would have started with $F(n)$.
Therefore, in the next iteration the smallest fractional value must be $x_2$.
We continue this until we have cycled through all variables.

Another example would be the opposite strategy: Choosing the maximum in each iteration.
In this case, the Fibonacci numbers are defined as
\begin{align*}
  F(0) = \dots = F(d) = 1, \qquad F(n + 1) = F(n) + F(n - d).
\end{align*}

The golden ratios for each definition is the limit of consecutive Fibonacci numbers
\[
  φ = \lim_{n → ∞} \frac{F(n + 1)}{F(n)},
\]
where $F(n)$ can be any of the previously defined Fibonacci numbers.

\section{Higher-Order Fibonacci Sequence for the Maximum Strategy}
\fi
% ==============================================================================

\begin{table}[tbp]
  \caption{The first 10 Fibonacci numbers for $d = 1, …, 5$ and their respective golden ratio.}
  \label{tbl:max-fibonacci}
  \centering
  \input{tables/max-fibonacci}
\end{table}

Next, we look at the opposite strategy:
Always taking the index with the maximum fractional value at each step.

The Fibonacci numbers are defined by the following recurrence relation:
\begin{align*}
  F(0) = F(1) = \dots = F(d) = 1, \qquad F(n + d + 1) = F(n + d) + F(n).
\end{align*}
The respective golden ratio $φ$ for this sequence is the positive root of the polynomial
\begin{align*}
  p(x) = x^{d+1} - x^d - 1.
\end{align*}

\begin{definition}
  A linear recurrence with coefficients~$a_0, \dots, a_d$ is an equation of the
  following form:
  \[
    F(n + 1) = a_0 F(n - d) + a_1 F(n - d + 1) + \dots + a_{d-1} F(n - 1) + a_d F(n).
  \]
\end{definition}

\iffalse % determinant
The golden ratio for this sequence also shows up for a different strategy.
When we choose two indices $ℓ$ and $ℓ'$ such that they minimize the ratio
$\{x_{ℓ'}\}/\{x_{ℓ}\}$, then we can bound the decrease of the determinant over
two iterations using the golden ratio $φ$.

% TODO: I feel like this was using $ψ = φ^{-1}$ instead of $φ$.
\begin{theorem}
  The determinant decreases by at least $φ^{d+1}$ over two iterations with $d ≥ 2$.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
  We assume WLOG that the vector is sorted in increasing order and
  $0 ≤ x_i ≤ 1$ for every $i ≤ d$.
  For a contradiction, assume the algorithm yields a smaller decrease than $φ^{d+1}$ on input $x$.
  We must have $x_i > φ^{d+1-i}$ for every $i = 1, \dots, d$.
  For the first value, we have $x₁ > φ^d$, because otherwise we have a total decrease of
  \[
    x₁ \left\{ \frac{x₂}{x₁} \right\} ≤ φ^{d-1} - φ^d = φ^{2d+1} < φ^d.
  \]
  Suppose $x_i > φ^{d+1-i}$ and $x_{i+1} ≤ φ^{d-i}$.
  Then we can achieve a total decrease of
  \[
    x_i · \left\{ \frac{x_{i+1}}{x_i} \right\} ≤ x_{i+1} - x_i < φ^{d-i} - φ^{d+1-i} = φ^{2d+1-i} < φ^d.
  \]
  It follows that $x_i > φ^{d+1-i}$ for every $i ≤ d$.
  But then
  \[
    x_d \left\{ \frac{1}{x_d} \right\} ≤ 1 - x_d < 1 - φ = φ^{d+1}.
  \]
  Hence, we achieve a decrease of at least $φ^{d+1}$ over two iterations.
\end{proof}

The bound for this strategy is tight.
We can construct an input that moves arbitrarily close to this bound.
Formally, for every sufficiently small $ε > 0$, we can find an input $x$ which
achieves a decrease of at most $φ^{d+1} - ε$.
The idea is to choose $x_d$ to be just over $φ$ and all other variables as a multiple of $x_d$
such that we have to choose $x_d$.
But choosing $x_d$ only gives us a decrease of $φ^{d+1} - ε$ in total.

% TODO: Explain what sufficiently small means
\begin{theorem}
  For every (sufficiently small) $ε > 0$,
  there exists an input $x ∈ ℝ^d$ with $d ≥ 2$,
  which achieves a decrease in the determinant of exactly $φ^{d+1} - ε$ over two
  iterations.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
  We choose $x_i = φ^{d+1-i} (1 + ε)$ for $i = 1, \dots, d$.
  The strategy chooses between
  \[
    \left\{ \frac{x_{i+1}}{x_i} \right\}
    = \frac{φ^{d-i} (1 + ε)}{φ^{d+1-i} (1 + ε)} - 1 = \frac{1}{φ} - 1,
    \text{ and }
    \left\{ \frac{1}{x_d} \right\}
    = \frac{1}{φ + ε} - 1
  \]
  Clearly, the strategy chooses $x_d$ since its ratio $\{1/x_d\}$ is the smallest.
  Therefore, the total decrease over two iterations is
  \[
    (φ + ε) \left\{ \frac{1}{φ + ε} \right\} = 1 - φ - ε = φ^{d+1} - ε.
    \qedhere
  \]
\end{proof}

% begin periodicity
Given, the linear recurrence $F(n + d + 1) = F(n) + a_1 F(n - 1) + \dots + a_d F(n + d)$,
the value for $x_i^{(n)}$ in the solution $x^{(n)}$ is
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:general-solution}
  x_i^{(n)} = \frac{F(n - i) + \sum_{k=1}^{i-1} a_{d-k} F(n - k)}{F(n)}.
\end{equation}

\begin{lemma}
  Pivoting with the first element of $x^{(n)}$ using the modified update rule yields the vector
  \[
    x' = (x^{(n-1)}_2, x^{(n-1)}_3, \dots, x^{(n-1)}_d, x^{(n-1)}_1).
  \]
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
  For $x_1$, we get
  \[
    \begin{aligned}
      \frac{1}{x_1}
      & = \frac{F(n)}{F(n - 1)} \\
      & = a_d + \frac{F(n - d - 1) + a_1 F(n - d - 2) + \dots + a_{d-1} F(n - 2)}{F(n - 1)} \\
      & = a_d + x^{(n-1)}_d.
    \end{aligned}
  \]
  For the other values, we get
  \begin{align*}
    \frac{x_i}{x_1}
    & = \frac{F(n - i) + \sum_{k=1}^{i-1} a_{d-k} F(n - k)}{F(n)} \frac{F(n)}{F(n - 1)} \\
    & = a_{d-1} + \frac{F(n - i) + \sum_{k=2}^{i-1} a_{d-k} F(n - k)}{F(n-1)} \\
    & = x^{(n-1)}_{i+1} \qedhere
  \end{align*}
\end{proof}

\begin{corollary}
  Running the generalized Euclidean algorithm with $x^{(n)}$ as the solution to
  the linear system $B x = c$ requires $n$ steps, if $x^{(n)}_1$ is the
  smallest element in $x^{(n)}$.
\end{corollary}

Of course, the Euclidean algorithm receives a matrix $B \in \Z^{d \times d}$
and vector $c \in \Z^d$ as its input and not the solution $x$ itself.
However, we can construct a very simple linear system $B^{(n)} x = c^{(n)}$,
where $x^{(n)}$ is the solution, in the following way:
\[
  B^{(n)} = F(n) I_d, \qquad c^{(n)}_k = \sum_{i=0}^k a_{d-i} F(n - i) \text{ for } k ≤ d.
\]

\section{Multi-Dimensional Golden Ratios and Mettallic Means}
% ==============================================================================

% begin convergence
Dividing two consecutive Fibonacci numbers approaches the golden ratio as $n$ increases.
The golden ratio is a solution to the equation $x^2 - x - 1 = 0$.
For higher dimensions, we will encounter similar polynomial equations with higher degree.
The goal of this section is to generalize the relationship between linear
recurrences like the Fibonacci sequence with their respective golden ratio.

\begin{definition}
  The \emph{characteristic polynomial} of a linear recurrence~$F$ with
  non-negative integer coefficients~$a_0, \dots, a_d$ is defined as
  \[
    p_F(x) = x^{d+1} - a_d x^d - a_{d-1} x^{d-1} - \dots - a_1 x - a_0.
  \]
\end{definition}

% TODO: Why is the characteristic polynomial defined as such, any reason?

\begin{example}
  The characteristic polynomial of the $d$-bonacci sequence is
  \[
    x^{d+1} - x^d - ⋯ - x - 1.
  \]
\end{example}

The root can be considered a generalization of the golden ratio.
If we weaken the requirement that each coefficient $a_i$ is either $0$ or $1$ and
instead allow any nonnegative number $a_i ∈ ℤ_{≥ 0}$, then this can be considered a
generalization of the metallic means.

The question for the higher-order Fibonacci sequence is whether they behave the
same way the classical Fibonacci numbers do.
Most importantly, whether their ratios
\[
  r_n
  := \frac{F(n+1)}{F(n)}
  = \frac{a_0 F(n - d)}{F(n)} + \frac{a₁ F(n - d + 1)}{F(n)} + ⋯ + \frac{a_{d-1} F(n-1)}{F(n)} + 1.
\]
are actually converging to the only positive real root of their characteristic
polynomial $p_F$ or not.
In the following, we will show that this is indeed the case.
First, we rewrite the terms of the equation such that each ratio in the sum can
be rewritten as a product of consecutive ratios $r_{n-i}$:
\begin{align*}
  \frac{F(n - d + i)}{F(n)}
  & = \frac{F(n - d + i + 1)}{F(n - d + i)} \frac{F(n - d + i + 2)}{F(n - d + i + 1)} \dots \frac{F(n-1)}{F(n)} \\
  & = \frac{1}{r_{n - d + i}} · \frac{1}{r_{n - d + i + 1}} · \dots · \frac{1}{r_{n-1}}.
\end{align*}
So we can calculate the ratio $r_n$ using the previous ratios $r_{n-1}, r_{n-2}, …, r_{n-d}$ as follows:
\[
  r_n = 1 + \frac{a_d}{r_{n-1}} + \frac{a_{d-1}}{r_{n-1} r_{n-2}} + ⋯ + \frac{a₀}{r_{n-1} r_{n-2} \dots r_{n-d}}.
\]
Using this equation, we can show that the ratios must be bounded.

\begin{lemma}
  The ratios $r_n$ are bounded between $1$ and $d+1$.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
  The first $d - 1$ ratios are all $1$.
  The ratio $r_d$ is equal to
  \[
    \frac{F(d+1)}{F(d)} = \frac{F(0) + F(1) + ⋯ + F(d)}{F(d)} = \frac{1 + 1 + ⋯ + 1}{1} = d + 1,
  \]
  which clearly satisfies the bounds of this lemma.
  By induction, suppose that the previous ratios $r_{n-1}, r_{n-2}, …, r_{n-d}$
  all satisfy the bound between $1$ and $d+1$.
  From previous consideration, we can reformulate the ratio $r_n$ as follows:
  \[
    r_n = 1 + \frac{a₁}{r_{n-1}} + \frac{a₂}{r_{n-1} r_{n-2}} + \dots + \frac{a_d}{r_{n-1} r_{n-2} \dots r_{n-d}}.
  \]
  Since $r_{n-i} ≤ d+1$, we can bound $r_n$ from below by
  \[
    r_n ≥ 1 + \frac{a₁}{d+1} + \frac{a₂}{(d+1)^2} + \dots + \frac{a_d}{(d+1)^d} ≥ 1
  \]
  and since $r_{n-i} ≥ 1$, we can bound $r_n$ from above by
  \[
    r_n ≤ 1 + \frac{a₁}{1} + \frac{a₂}{1} + \dots + \frac{a_d}{1} ≤ d+1.
  \]
  Hence, $1 ≤ r_n ≤ d+1$ for every $n ≥ 0$.
\end{proof}

\begin{figure}[tbp]

    The sequences $s_n$ and $t_n$ are the minimum and maximum from a subset of
    those numbers, respectively.
    Both sequences converge towards the same limit $φ$, so the ratios converge
    towards this limit, too.
  }
  \label{fig:fibonacci-convergence}
\end{figure}

Showing that the sequence is monotone would be enough to show the convergence.
However, the sequence is clearly not monotone.
Even the ratios of the original Fibonacci sequence alternate between increasing
and decreasing.
So we cannot possibly prove that the higher-order sequences are monotone.
Instead, we bound the sequence between two other sequences $s_n$ and $t_n$
and show that the two sequences are converging to the same limit.
From the squeeze theorem, it follows that $r_n$ converges to the same limit.
The main idea is illustrated in Figure~\ref{fig:fibonacci-convergence}.
The sequences are
\[
  s_n = \min\{r_n, r_{n-1}, …, r_{n-d} \}, \qquad t_n = \max\{r_n, r_{n-1}, …, r_{n-d}\}
\]
Because $r_n$ clearly lies between the two sequences, so it must converge to the same limit as $s_n$ and $t_n$.
For these sequences, we already know from the previous lemma that they are bounded,
so it only remains to be shown that they are monotone,
where $s_n$ is always increasing and $t_n$ is decreasing.

\begin{lemma}
  The sequences $s_n$ and $t_n$ are monotone.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
  Each ratio can be represented as a convex combination of the previous ratios, i.e.
  \[
    r_{n+1} = λ₀ r_n + λ₁ r_{n-1} + \dots + λ_d r_{n-d}
  \]
  using $λ_i = F(n - i) / F(n + 1)$.
  To show that this is indeed a convex combination, all coefficients $λ_i$
  need to be non-negative and $λ₀ + λ₁ + \dots + \lambda_d = 1$.
  The former follows from the fact that Fibonacci numbers are always increasing,
  while the latter follows simply from the definition of the Fibonacci numbers.
  Because $s_n$ is the minimum and $t_n$ the maximum of $r_n, r_{n-1}, …, r_{n-d}$,
  we can bound the next maximum by
  \[
    t_{n+1} ≤ r_{n+1} = λ₀ r_n + λ₁ r_{n-1} + \dots + λ_d r_{n-d} ≤ λ₀ t_n + λ₁ t_n + ⋯ + λ_d t_n = t_n.
  \]
  and the next minimum by
  \[
    s_{n+1} ≥ r_{n+1} = λ₀ r_n + λ₁ r_{n-1} + \dots + λ_d r_{n-d} ≥ λ₀ s_n + λ₁ s_n + ⋯ + λ_d s_n = s_n.
  \]
  Therefore, $s_n ≤ s_{n+1} ≤ t_{n+1} ≤ t_n$.
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}
  The sequences $s_n$ and $t_n$ are converging to the same limit.
\end{lemma}

% TODO: Finish this proof
\begin{proof}
  For a contradiction, suppose there exists some $δ > 0$ such that $t_n - s_n > δ$ for every $n ≥ 0$.
  Out of the previous ratios, there must be one ratio $r_k$ exactly equal to $t_n$.
  Therefore,
  \begin{align*}
    s_{n+1} ≥ r_n & = λ₀ r_{n-d-1} + λ₁ r_{n-d} + ⋯ + λ_d r_{n-1} \\
                  & ≥ λ_k t_n + \sum_{i ≠ k} λ_i s_n \\
                  & = λ_k t_n + (1 - λ_k) s_n = s_n + λ_k (t_n - s_n) ≥ s_n + λ_k δ.
  \end{align*}
  We have
  \[
    λ_k = \frac{F(n+k)}{F(n+d+1)} = \frac{1}{r_{n+k} r_{n+k+1} \dots r_{n+d+1}} ≥ \frac{1}{(d+1)^{d+1-k}}.
  \]
  Hence, $λ_k$ is always greater than some constant $c > 0$ for every $k ≥ 0$.
  But then
  \[
    s_{n+i} ≥ s_{n+i-1} + c δ ≥ s_{n+i-2} + 2c δ ≥ \dots ≥ s_n + i c δ
  \]
  and $s_{n+i}$ would always increase as $i$ approaches infinity,
  which contradicts the previous lemma.
  Therefore, $δ = 0$ and it follows that $s_n$ and $t_n$ are approaching the same limit.
\end{proof}

% TODO: Show that this converges! We're still missing the convergence criteria
\begin{theorem}
  Let $F$ be a linear recurrence with coefficients $a_0, \dots, a_d ∈ \{0,1\}$
  and let $φ$ be the real positive root of its characteristic polynomial.
  Then,
  \[
    \lim_{n \to \infty} \frac{F(n + 1)}{F(n)} = φ.
  \]
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
  By the previous lemma, the ratios $r_n$ approach some limit $r$. It follows:
  \[
    r
    = \lim_{n → ∞} r_n
    = \lim_{n → ∞} 1 + \frac{a_d}{r_{n-1}} + \frac{a_{d-1}}{r_{n-1} r_{n-2}} + ⋯ + \frac{a₀}{r_{n-1} r_{n-2} \dots r_{n-d}}.
  \]
  Hence, each denominator in the sum approaches $r^i$,
  which results in the following polynomial:
  \[
    r = a₀ + \sum_{i = 1}^d \frac{a_{d - i}}{r^i}
    \iff
    r^{d+1} = a₀ + a₁ r + \dots + a_d r^d,
  \]
  which directly corresponds to a root of its characteristic polynomial.
  Furthermore, the ratios are always positive, so $r = φ$.
\end{proof}

\begin{corollary}
  For the same recurrence $F$, $\lim_{n → ∞} F(n + i) / F(n) = φ^i$ for $i > 1$.
\end{corollary}

%begin{periodicity}
The previous theorem leads us straight to an algebraic solution vector,
for which the generalized Euclidean algorithm is periodic.
We simply use the previous vector $x^{(n)}$ defined for the Fibonacci sequence
and increase $n$ towards infinity:
\begin{align*}
  x_i
  & = \lim_{n → ∞} x_i^{(n)} \\
  & = \lim_{n → ∞} \frac{F(n - i) + \sum_{k=1}^{i-1} a_{d-k} F(n - k)}{F(n)} \\
  & = φ^{d-i} + \sum_{k=1}^{i-1} a_{d-k} φ^{d-k}.
\end{align*}

\begin{theorem}
  The generalized Euclidean algorithm is periodic for $x = (φ, φ^2, …, φ^d)$,
  where $φ$ is the positive root of the polynomial
  \[
    x^{d+1} - a_{d} x^d - ⋯ - a_1 x - a₀
  \]
  with $a_0, a_1, …, a_d ∈ ℤ_{≥ 0}$.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
  We pivot with $ℓ = 1, 2, …, d$ twice.
  In the first round, we get a vector $x'$ with
  \[
    x_i' = ...
  \]
  Once we have the vector $x'$, applying the generalized Euclidean algorithm
  will produce the vector $x''$ with
  \[
    x_ℓ'' = …, x_i'' = …
  \]
  So the algorithm just rotates the elements one spot to the right.
  Applying the algorithm $d$ times with the indices $1, 2, …, d$
  amounts to a complete rotation where each value ends up where it started.
  Therefore, we have reached $x'$ again and the algorithm becomes periodic.
\end{proof}

%begin{inverse golden ratio}
\iffalse
\begin{definition}
  Given a polynomial $p = \sum_{i=0}^n a_i x^n$, its \emph{reciprocal polynomial},
  denoted as $p^*$, is defined as
  \[
    p^*(x) = x^n p(x^{-1}) = a_n + a_{n-1} x + \dots + a_0 x^n.
  \]
\end{definition}

\begin{example}
  The reciprocal of the golden ratio polynomial $x^2 - x - 1$ is
  \begin{align*}
    x^2 + x - 1,
  \end{align*}
  which has a root at $ψ = 1/φ$.
\end{example}

\begin{lemma}
  Let $p$ be a polynomial. Then, $a$ is a root of $p$ if and only if $a^{-1}$ is a root of $p^*$.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
  Let $a$ be a root of $p$. It follows $p^*(a^{-1}) = a^n p(a) = a^n \cdot 0 = 0$.
  Now let $a^{-1}$ be a root of $p^*$. Then $p^*(a^{-1}) = a^n p(a) = 0$.
  By construction, $a$ cannot be zero and therefore we must have $p(a) = 0$.
\end{proof}

\section{Metallic Ratios}
% ==============================================================================

The result from the previous section can be generalized to an even larger class
of polynomials by allowing $a_1, a_2, …, a_d ∈ \Z_{≥ 0}$ instead of only binary
values.
The roots of these polynomials can be seen as a generalization of the metallic ratios.
Indeed, for the one-dimensional case the polynomials are
\[
  x^2 - a₁ x - 1,
\]
which characterizes all possible metallic ratios, like the silver ratio ($a₁ = 2$) or
the bronze ratio ($a₁ = 3$).
The generalization considers higher-degree polynomials of the form
\[
  x^{d+1} - a_d x^d - \dots - a_1 x - 1
\]
with non-negative integer coefficients $a_1, a_2, …, a_d$.
Each of these polynomials has a corresponding linear recurrence,
which can be reconstructed by the characteristic polynomial.
For the linear recurrence,
the ratios of consecutive terms approaches the real positive root of the
polynomial again.
