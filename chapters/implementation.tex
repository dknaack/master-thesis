\chapter{Notes on the Implementation}

\section{Using an Out-of-the-Box Solver}

\begin{itemize}
  \item Algorithm technically only requires one fractional bit to determine how to round.
  \item Problem: Solving a system of linear equations requires exact fractional solutions.
    Using floating-point numbers leads to inaccurate results.
  \item Could be solved by using an iterative method? However, does a method
    exist, which is accurate up to one fractional bit?
\end{itemize}

\section{Custom Implementation}

\begin{itemize}
  \item Uses custom \texttt{ratio} datatype which implements rational numbers.
  \item Linear system solver implemented using Gaussian elimination and pivoting.
  \item Only the basic algorithm is implemented, so far.
\end{itemize}
