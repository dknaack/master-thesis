\begin{example}
  The sequences for the prime numbers are:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item $2^{1/3}$: $0\overline{10}$.
    \item $3^{1/3}$: $01\overline{01}$.
    \item $5^{1/3}$: $0\overline{00111000}$.
    \item $7^{1/3}$: $0\overline{010100}$.
    \item $11^{1/3}$: $0\overline{1100}$.
    \item $13^{1/3}$: $00\overline{010000}$.
    \item $17^{1/3}$: $000\overline{11110000}$.
    \item Another choice for $5^{1/3}$ with shorter period: $00110\overline{101010}$.
  \end{itemize}
\end{example}

\begin{remark}
  The first number that has a leading $1$ as the pivot is $12$,
  which has the pivot sequence $1\overline{0111011101}$.
  However, there are other possible choices where it does not have a leading $0$.

\section{Finding an Efficient Search Strategy}

We can likely rule out alternating pivot sequences since this corresponds to
the Jacobi-Perron algorithm and for this algorithm it is conjectured
\cite{Karpenkov2024} that the algorithm is not periodic for $\sqrt[3]{4}$.
However, the brute-force algorithm is periodic for this input (see Table~\ref{table:cube-root-4}).

The choice of the initial input also matters.
We generally choose $x = (α, q(α))$, where $q$ is some polynomial of degree $2$.
But different choices of $q$ produce different sequences.
For example, $(\sqrt[3]{2}, \sqrt[3]{4})$ produces a different sequence of coefficients than $(\sqrt[3]{2}, \sqrt[3]{6})$.
Even though both inputs represent the same number $\sqrt[3]{2}$.
Choosing $q(α) = α^2 - α$ makes the sequence purely periodic for $\sqrt[3]{3}$ and $\sqrt[3]{4}$.
