\chapter{Notes on Hermite's Question}

\begin{problem}[Hermite's Question]
  Is there a representation of the real numbers as a sequence of integers such
  that the sequence is eventually periodic if and only if the real number is a
  cubic irrational?
\end{problem}

More formally: Does there exists a function $f$ which maps any $α ∈ ℝ$ to an
infinite sequence $(a_n)_{n ∈ ℕ}$ of natural numbers such that $a_n$ is
eventually periodic if and only if $x$ is a cubic irrational?

For any $d$th irrational number $x ∈ ℝ$, we can find a unique irreducible polynomial $p(x) ∈ ℚ[x]$
which has $x$ as its root and is monic.
Furthermore, it must have $d$ distinct roots $α₁, α₂, \dots, α_d ∈ ℂ$,
where one of them is $x$.

\section{$\sin^2$ Algorithm}

Let $p$ be an irreducible cubic polynomial over $ℚ$ with integer coefficients.
The roots $α, β, γ$ are called \emph{conjugates}.

Given a linear basis $q₀, q₁, q₂$ over degree $2$ polynomials over $ℚ$,
the vectors
\[
  \begin{pmatrix}
    q₀(α) \\
    q₁(α) \\
    q₂(α) \\
  \end{pmatrix},
  \begin{pmatrix}
    q₀(β) \\
    q₁(β) \\
    q₂(β) \\
  \end{pmatrix},
  \begin{pmatrix}
    q₀(γ) \\
    q₁(γ) \\
    q₂(γ) \\
  \end{pmatrix}
\]
are called cubic conjugate vectors.

A triple of cubic conjugate vectors $a, b, c$ is called totally-real, if there
exists a matrix $B ∈ \text{SL}(3, ℤ)$ with irreducible characteristic
polynomial over $ℚ$ such that $a, b, c$ are eigenvectors of $B$ with distinct
eigenvalues.

\section{HAPD algorithm}

See \cite{Karpenkov2024}.
Given a monic irreducible polynomial $p(x)$ over $ℚ$ with integer coefficients and roots $α₁, \dots, α_d ∈ \overline{ℚ}$,
we can find algebraic vectors $v_1, \dots, v_d$ for each root $α_i$:
\[
  v_i = (q_0(α_i), q_1(α_i), q_2(α_i), \dots, q_{d-1}(α_i)),
\]
where the polynomials $q_i$ must have degree $i$, respectively.
The choice of $q_i$ does not matter as long as they have degree $i$.
Furthermore, we can find a rational matrix $C(p) ∈ ℚ^{d × d}$ such that $v_1, \dots, v_d$ are the eigenvectors of $M$.
Let $p(x) = x^d + a_{d-1} x^{d-1} + \dots + a₁ x^1 + a₀$, then
\[
  C(p) =
  \begin{pmatrix}
    0 & 0 & \dots & 0 & -a₀ \\
    1 & 0 & \dots & 0 & -a₁ \\
    0 & 1 & \dots & 0 & -a₂ \\
    \vdots & \vdots & \ddots & \vdots & \vdots \\
    0 & 0 & \dots & 1 & -a_{d-1} \\
  \end{pmatrix},
\]
By multiplying all elements of this matrix with the least common multiple of the denominators in $C(p)$,
we can turn it into an integer matrix.
The matrix $C(p)$ is also called the \emph{companion matrix} of $p$.

The matrix naturally gives rise to a linear recurrence of the form
\[
  F(n + d) = -a_{d-1} F(n + d - 1) - \dots - a_1 F(n + 1) - a_0 F(n).
\]
For example, when $d = 2$ and $a_0 = a_1 = -1$, the linear recurrence
corresponds to the Fibonacci sequence.

\begin{definition}
  The \emph{Markov-Davenport characteristic} of a vector $x ∈ ℝ^3$ with respect to vectors $u, v, w ∈ ℝ^3$
  is defined as
  \[
    \det
    \begin{pmatrix}
      x_1 & v_1 & w_1 \\
      x_2 & v_2 & w_2 \\
      x_3 & v_3 & w_3 \\
    \end{pmatrix}
    · \det
    \begin{pmatrix}
      u_1 & x_1 & w_1 \\
      u_2 & x_2 & w_2 \\
      u_3 & x_3 & w_3 \\
    \end{pmatrix}
    · \det
    \begin{pmatrix}
      u_1 & v_1 & x_1 \\
      u_2 & v_2 & x_2 \\
      u_3 & v_3 & x_3 \\
    \end{pmatrix}
  \]
\end{definition}

\section{Brute-Force Search}

\begin{itemize}
  \item Using breadth-first search over all possible sequences.
  \item Pivots for $2^{1/3}$: $0\overline{10}$.
  \item Pivots for $3^{1/3}$: $01\overline{01}$.
  \item Pivots for $5^{1/3}$: $0\overline{00111000}$.
  \item Pivots for $7^{1/3}$: $0\overline{010100}$.
  \item Pivots for $11^{1/3}$: $0\overline{1100}$.
  \item Pivots for $13^{1/3}$: $00\overline{010000}$.
  \item Pivots for $17^{1/3}$: $000\overline{11110000}$.
  \item Another choice for $5^{1/3}$ with shorter period: $00110\overline{101010}$.
  \item Alternating pivots is likely not possible as this corresponds to the
    Jacobi-Perron algorithm.
    For example, for the number $4^{1/3}$ there is likely no alternating period.
  \item The first number with a leading $1$ as the pivot is $12$: $1\overline{0111011101}$.
\end{itemize}

\begin{lemma}
  \label{lem:consecutive-same}
  For every $k ∈ ℕ$, there exists a number $n ∈ ℕ$,
  such that $\sqrt[3]{n}$ and $\sqrt[3]{n + 1}$ have the same first $k$ terms in
  their pivot sequences.
\end{lemma}

\iffalse
\begin{theorem}
  There exists no algorithm which given $x ∈ ℝ^d$ can determine the same
  strategy as the brute-force search using only $f(d)$ comparison, addition
  and subtraction operations, for some computable function $f \colon ℕ → ℕ$.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
  Idea: A constant-number of additions and subtraction only compare the integer
  parts of each $x_i$ when the values are chosen close enough to an integer.
  Because the trees are the same for the first level, the output for both
  inputs must be the same.

  We choose $x₁ = f(d)$ and $x₂ = \sqrt{f(d) + 1}$ where $n^3 > f(d)$.
  In particular, $x₁$ is an integer and $x₂$ is between $x₁$ and the next integer.
  Suppose the algorithm compares $a₁ x₁$ with $a₂ x₂$ for $|a₁|, |a₂| ≤ f(d)$.
  \[
    a₂ x₂
    = a₂ \sqrt{(f(d))^2 + i + 1}
    ≤ a₂ \left( f(d) + \frac{1}{3 f(d)} \right)
    = a₂ · f(d) + \frac{a₂}{3 f(d)} \right)
  \]
  Furthermore, $a₂ x₂ ≥ a₂ · f(d)$.
  Therefore, the integer part of $a₂ x₂$ is equal to $a₂ x₁$,
  even if $a₂ = f(d)$.
  Hence, any algorithm can only compare the integer parts of $x₁$ and $x₂$.
\end{proof}
