\chapter{Continued Fractions}

Continued fractions are fractions of the form
\[
  a_0 + \cfrac{1}{a_1 + \cfrac{1}{a_2 + \cfrac{1}{a_3 + \cfrac{1}{a_4 + \ddots}}}},
\]
where $a₀$ can be any integer and $a₁, a₂, \dots$ must be positive integers.
These fractions are helpful when analyzing the Euclidean algorithm since
the number of steps on any input $a, b$ is entirely determined by the continued
fraction representation of $a/b$.

\section{Reversing the Pivot Operation}

We can reverse the pivot operation.
In this case, the inverse operation takes not only the output and the index $ℓ$,
but also the integer part $a = (a₁, \dots, a_d)$ of each input value.
Given $x ∈ ℚ^d$, an index $ℓ$ and $a ∈ ℤ^d$, the vector $x = pivot^{-1}(y, ℓ, a)$ is defined as follows:
\[
  x_ℓ = a_ℓ + \frac{1}{y_ℓ}, \quad x_i = a_i + \frac{y_i}{y_ℓ} \text{ for } i ≠ ℓ.
\]

The reverse pivot operation allows us to describe any rational vector $x ∈ ℚ^d$ as a
sequence of indices $ℓ$ and integer vectors $a$.
However, this representation is not unique for every vector,
since any vector with at least two non-integer numbers has two different
choices for the pivot $ℓ$.
Hence, we can find at least two different representations for this vector.

\section{Maximum Continued Fractions}

The first strategy was choosing the minimal fractional value in each iteration.
For the corresponding multi-dimensional continued fraction,
we actually choose the maximum out of all elements.
Suppose we have an input vector $x$ along with its integer part $a$.
Then, the fractional value $x_ℓ - a_ℓ$ is minimal among all other elements of $x$.
Hence, in the continued fraction representation
\[
  x_ℓ - a_ℓ = \frac{1}{y_ℓ} < \frac{y_i}{y_ℓ} = x_i - a_i.
\]
Because we are dealing with fractional values, this means that both values must
me smaller than one and then $y_i$ must be smaller than $y_ℓ$.
From this, it follows that choosing the smallest fractional value corresponds
to choosing the largest value from the multi-dimensional continued fraction.

This allows us to remove the index from the previous continued fraction representation.
We can simply calculate the index from the fractions themselves.

\begin{definition}
  Let $a_1, \dots, a_d ∈ ℤ$ and $a_{d+1}, \dots, a_{dn} ∈ ℕ \setminus \{0\}$ for $n ≥ 0$.
  The maximum continued fractions are defined as:
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item If $n = 1$, then $[a_i, \dots, a_d] := a_i$ for $i ≤ d$.
    \item If $n > 1$, then let
      $ℓ = \argmax_i \, [a_{d+i}, \dots, a_{dn}]$ and
    \begin{align*}
      [a_i, \dots, a_{dn}]
      & :=
      \begin{cases}
        \displaystyle
        a_i + \frac{[a_{d+i}, \dots, a_{dn}]}{[a_{d+ℓ}, \dots, a_{dn}]},
        & \text{ if } i = ℓ, \\
        \displaystyle
        a_ℓ + \frac{1}{[a_{d+ℓ}, \dots, a_{dn}]},
        & \text{ otherwise. }
      \end{cases}
    \end{align*}
  \end{enumerate}
\end{definition}

\begin{remark}
  In case of a tie, we choose the first element.
  In particular, when the last $d$ elements of the sequence are all equal, then we define $\argmax_i a_i = 1$.
\end{remark}

\begin{proposition}
  Given a continued fraction $x = [a₁, \dots, a_d; a_{d+1}, \dots, a_{dn}]$,
  the generalized Euclidean algorithm requires exactly $n - 1$ steps
  when choosing the minimum fractional value.
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}
  When $n = 1$, the input consists solely of integers.
  Therefore, the Euclidean algorithm immediately stops.

  Per induction, assume that the algorithm requires $n - 2$ steps for
  the continued fraction $x' = [a_{d+1}, \dots, a_{2d}; a_{2d+1}, \dots, a_{dn}]$.
  Given $x$, the algorithm chooses the minimum fractional value $\{x_ℓ\}$.

\end{proof}

The smallest purely periodic continued fraction is $[\overline{1, \dots, 1}]$.
