\chapter{Preliminaries}
\label{ch:preliminaries}

In this chapter, I recount many important definitions and theorems, which will
be used in the later chapters.
This includes a brief overview of algebraic number theory and a recount of the
classical Euclidean algorithm.
This chapter draws on standard results from algebraic number theory, as
presented in \cite{Dummit04}.

\section{The Euclidean Algorithm}

We begin with the Euclidean algorithm,
since it stands at the center of this thesis:
It is used to construct continued fractions,
it is the basis of the generalized Euclidean algorithm
and through its worst-case analysis it leads to the Fibonacci numbers and their
generalization to higher dimensions.

The input to the algorithm is a pair of integers $a, b$ with $a > b$ and the
goal is to find the greatest common divisor between the two numbers. The
algorithm works in two steps.

\begin{Pseudocode}
algorithm Euclidean(a, b)
  while $b ≠ 0$ do
    $b' ← a \bmod b$ // modulo
    $(a, b) ← (b', a)$ // exchange
  end
  return $a$
end
\end{Pseudocode}

In summary, the Euclidean algorithm uses the following steps:
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Modulo}: $b' ← a \bmod b$.
  \item \textbf{Exchange}: $(a, b) ← (b', a)$.
  \item \textbf{Termination}: $b = 0$
\end{itemize}

The Euclidean algorithm not only works on integers,
but can be extended to any ring with a division with remainder operation.
Recall that a ring is a set $R$ equipped with two operations -- addition and
multiplication -- that behaves like the integers:
it forms an abelian group under addition and is closed under multiplication,
which is associative and distributes over addition.
A ring need not have multiplicative inverses or a multiplicative identity.
In this thesis, all rings will contain $1$ and be commutative unless stated
otherwise.

\begin{definition}
  An \emph{integral domain} is a ring $R$ in which $1 ≠ 0$ and for every $a, b ∈ R$,
  \[
    ab = 0 \implies a = 0 \text{ or } b = 0.
  \]
\end{definition}

An integral domain is a ring without zero divisors.
The Euclidean algorithm can be extended to any integral domain,
which defines an additional division with remainder operation.
Such a ring is called an Euclidean domain.

\begin{definition}
  A \emph{Euclidean domain} $(R, f)$ is an integral domain $R$ with a function $f$,
  which maps any nonzero element of $R$ to a nonnegative integer,
  such that for every two elements $a$ and $b$ of $R$, there exist elements $q$ and $r$ of $R$ with
  \[
    a = qb + r \quad \text{ and } \quad r = 0 \text{ or } f(r) < f(b).
  \]
  The element $q$ is called the \emph{quotient} and $r$ is called the \emph{remainder}.
  The function $f$ is called a \emph{Euclidean function}.
\end{definition}

\begin{example}
  % TODO: Real numbers using a different division with remainder
  Consider the real numbers with the Euclidean function $f(r) = r$.
  One possible division just uses the quotient $q = ab^{-1}$.
  However,
  another possible division operation would be
  \[
    a = \underbrace{\floor{\frac{a}{b}}}_q b + \underbrace{\left\{ \frac{a}{b} \right\} b}_r
  \]
\end{example}

\begin{example}
  Consider the ring $ℚ[x]$ of polynomials with rational coefficients.
  For any two polynomials $f(x), g(x) ∈ ℚ[x]$,
  we can find polynomials $q(x), r(x) ∈ ℚ[x]$ such that
  \[
    f(x) = q(x) g(x) + r(x)
    \quad
    \text{ and }
    \quad
    \deg(r) ≤ \deg(f).
  \]
  In this case, $\deg(f)$ is the Euclidean function and $q(x), r(x)$ are
  the quotient and remainder, respectively.
\end{example}

\begin{definition}
  A polynomial $f(x) ∈ ℚ[x]$ is \emph{irreducible},
  if there exists no polynomial $g(x)$ which divides $f(x)$.
\end{definition}

\section{Algebraic Numbers}

\begin{definition}
  A real number $α$ is said to be \emph{algebraic} if its the root of some polynomial
  with integer coefficients.
  If $α$ is not algebraic, then it is said to be \emph{transcendental}.
\end{definition}

The set of algebraic numbers includes many familiar constants, such as $\sqrt{2}$ or $\frac{1}{2}$,
and plays a central role in number theory.
Transcendental numbers, such as $\pi$ and $e$, are those which cannot be expressed
as roots of integer polynomials, and are far less well understood.
This thesis focuses only on algebraic numbers and, in particular, on their
representation using continued fractions and their generalizations.

\begin{lemma}
  If $α$ is algebraic, then there exists a unique monic polynomial $f_α(x) ∈ ℚ[x]$
  of smallest degree with $α$ as a root.
\end{lemma}

Every algebraic number is associated with a unique monic polynomial over the rational numbers
of minimal degree, known as its \emph{minimal polynomial}.
This polynomial is irreducible and captures essential information about the algebraic number.
Its degree also determines the size of the smallest number field containing the number.

\begin{definition}
  A field $K$ is an \emph{number field} if it is a finite extension of $ℚ$.
  The \emph{degree} of the number field is defined as the degree of the field
  extension $[K : ℚ]$, i.e. the dimension of $K$ as a vector space over $ℚ$.
\end{definition}

Number fields form the natural setting for studying algebraic numbers.
By adjoining an algebraic number to $ℚ$, one obtains a field that contains all
rational linear combinations of its powers, up to the degree of its minimal polynomial.
These fields have finite dimension over $ℚ$, and that dimension is referred to as their degree.

\begin{example}
  \hfill
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item The rational numbers form a number field and they have degree $1$.
    \item The quadratic field $ℚ(\sqrt{2})$ is a number field.
      Any element in $ ℚ(\sqrt{2})$ can be written as $a + b \sqrt{2}$ with $a,b ∈ ℚ$
      and it is therefore a number field with degree $[ℚ(\sqrt{2}) : ℚ] = 2$.
    \item The field $ℚ(\sqrt[3]{2})$ is a number field.
      It contains all elements of the form $a + b \sqrt[3]{2} + c \sqrt[3]{2^2}$ with $a,b,c ∈ ℚ$.
      Therefore, $1, \sqrt[3]{{2}}, \sqrt[3]{4}$ forms a basis for the vector space over $ℚ$
      and the field $ℚ(\sqrt[3]{2})$ has degree $[ℚ(\sqrt[3]{2}) : ℚ] = 3$.
  \end{enumerate}
\end{example}

An important construction associated with number fields is the \emph{field norm}.
It provides a way of assigning a rational number to each element of a number field,
and can be defined using linear algebra.
Multiplication by an element $α ∈ K$ can be viewed as a linear transformation on $K$,
and the norm is defined as the determinant of this transformation.
For example, consider the field $ℚ(\sqrt{2})$ with basis $\{1, \sqrt{2}\}$.
Let $α = 1 + \sqrt{2}$.
Then for any element $x = a + b \sqrt{2}$, we compute
\[
  αx = (1 + \sqrt{2})(a + b \sqrt{2}) = a + a \sqrt{2} + b \sqrt{2} + 2b = (a + 2b) + (a + b)\sqrt{2}.
\]
So in the basis $\{1, \sqrt{2}\}$, this corresponds to the matrix
\[
  M_α =
  \begin{pmatrix}
    1 & 2 \\
    1 & 1
  \end{pmatrix}.
\]
The norm $N_{K/ℚ}(α)$ is then the determinant of $M_α$, which is $1 \cdot 1 - 2 \cdot 1 = -1$.

\begin{definition}
  Let $K$ be a number field.
  The \emph{field norm} $N_{K/ℚ}(α)$ of an element $α$ of $K$ is defined as the
  determinant of its multiplication matrix $M_α$.
\end{definition}

An immediate consequence of the definition is multiplicativity:
the norm of a product is equal to the product of the norms.
This makes it a valuable tool for reasoning about algebraic equations
and for connecting the arithmetic of $K$ to that of $ℚ$.

\begin{lemma}
  For every $α, β ∈ K$, their product has the norm $N_{K/ℚ}(αβ) = N_{K/ℚ}(α) · N_{K/ℚ}(β)$.
\end{lemma}
