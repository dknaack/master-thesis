\chapter{Preliminaries}
\label{ch:preliminaries}

This chapter introduces key concepts needed throughout this thesis.
We begin with the most important topic first,
which is the Euclidean algorithm.
It serves as the basis of continued fractions and its generalization.
Its analysis also leads to one of the first practical applications
of the Fibonacci numbers.
We proceed with the basics of algebraic number theory,
which is needed for the second part of Hermite's problem.
Finally, I give a brief introduction to lattice theory,
which is needed not only for the generalization of the Euclidean algorithm
but also for understanding the geometry of the continued fractions.

\section{The Euclidean Algorithm}
% ==============================================================================

The input to the algorithm is a pair of integers $(a, b)$ with $a > b$ and the
goal is to find the greatest common divisor between the two inputs.
The algorithm works in two steps.
The first step is to calculate the remainder when $a$ is divided by $b$.
We find an integer $q$ for the quotient and a remainder $r < b$ such that
\[
  a = q b + r.
\]
In the next step, $a$ is exchanged with $b$ and $b$ with $r$.
The algorithm continues with these two steps until the remainder $r$ equals zero.

\begin{lemma}
  If $a = qb + r$, then $\gcd(a, b) = \gcd(b, r)$.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
  Suppose $d = \gcd(b, r)$, then $b = b'd$ and $r = r'd$ for some integers $b'$ and $r'$.
  But then $d$ must also divide $a$, since $a = qb + r = d(qb' + r')$.
  Thus, $d ≤ \gcd(a, b)$.
  Next, suppose that $d = \gcd(a, b)$.
  Because $d$ divides $a = qb + r$ and $b$,
  it must also divide $r$.
  Hence, $d ≤ \gcd(b, r)$.
  Combining both inequalities, we get $\gcd(a, b) = \gcd(b, r)$.
\end{proof}

\begin{example}
  Let $a = 252$ and $b = 105$.
  The Euclidean algorithm proceeds as follows:
  \begin{alignat*}{2}
    252 & = 2 · 105 + 42 \\
    105 & = 2 · 42 + 21 \\
    42 & = 2 · 21 + 0.
  \end{alignat*}
  Thus, the greatest common divisor of $252$ and $105$ is $21$.
\end{example}

Since $r < b$, the inputs decrease at each iteration
and the Euclidean algorithm must terminate at some point.
Therefore, it correctly calculates the greatest common divisor between the two
inputs $a$ and $b$.
In summary, the algorithm uses the following steps:
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Modulo}: $b' ← a \bmod b$.
  \item \textbf{Exchange}: $(a, b) ← (b', a)$.
  \item \textbf{Termination}: $b = 0$
\end{itemize}

The Euclidean algorithm not only works on integers,
but can be extended to any ring with a division with remainder operation.
Recall that a ring is a set $R$ equipped with two operations -- addition and
multiplication -- that behaves like the integers:
it forms an abelian group under addition and is closed under multiplication,
which is associative and distributes over addition.
A ring need not have multiplicative inverses or a multiplicative identity.
In this thesis, all rings will contain $1$ and be commutative unless stated
otherwise.

\begin{definition}
  An \emph{integral domain} is a ring $R$ in which $1 ≠ 0$ and for every $a, b ∈ R$,
  \[
    ab = 0 \implies a = 0 \text{ or } b = 0.
  \]
\end{definition}

An integral domain is a ring without zero divisors.
The Euclidean algorithm can be extended to any integral domain,
which defines an additional division with remainder operation.
Such a ring is called an Euclidean domain.

\begin{definition}
  A \emph{Euclidean domain} $(R, f)$ is an integral domain $R$ with a function $f$,
  which maps any nonzero element of $R$ to a nonnegative integer,
  such that for every two elements $a$ and $b$ of $R$, there exist elements $q$ and $r$ of $R$ with
  \[
    a = qb + r \quad \text{ and } \quad r = 0 \text{ or } f(r) < f(b).
  \]
  The element $q$ is called the \emph{quotient} and $r$ is called the \emph{remainder}.
  The function $f$ is called a \emph{Euclidean function}.
\end{definition}

\begin{example}
  % TODO: Real numbers using a different division with remainder
  Consider the real numbers with the Euclidean function $f(r) = r$.
  One possible division just uses the quotient $q = ab^{-1}$.
  However,
  another possible division operation would be
  \[
    a = \underbrace{\floor{\frac{a}{b}}}_q b + \underbrace{\left\{ \frac{a}{b} \right\} b}_r
  \]
\end{example}

\begin{example}
  Consider the ring $ℚ[X]$ of polynomials with rational coefficients.
  For any two polynomials $f(X), g(X) ∈ ℚ[X]$,
  we can find polynomials $q(X), r(X) ∈ ℚ[X]$
  using polynomial division such that
  \[
    f(X) = q(X) g(X) + r(X)
    \quad
    \text{ and }
    \quad
    \deg(r) ≤ \deg(f).
  \]
  In this case, $\deg(f)$ is the Euclidean function and $q(X), r(X)$ are
  the quotient and remainder, respectively.
\end{example}

\begin{definition}
  A polynomial $f(X) ∈ ℚ[X]$ is \emph{irreducible},
  if there exists no polynomial $g(X)$ which divides $f(X)$.
\end{definition}

\section{Algebraic Numbers}
% ==============================================================================

This section draws on standard results from algebraic number theory, as presented in \cite{Dummit04}.
For a given field $K ⊆ L$ and an subset $S ⊆ L$,
the set $K(S)$ denotes the smallest field containing $K$ and $S$.
In the case that the set $S$ contains a single element $α ∈ L$, we simplify the
expression $ℚ(\{α\})$ to $ℚ(α)$.
In this thesis, we consider fields $ℚ(α)$ where the element $α$ is an algebraic number.

\begin{definition}
  A complex number $α$ is said to be \emph{algebraic} if its the root of some polynomial
  with integer coefficients.
  If $α$ is not algebraic, then it is said to be \emph{transcendental}.
\end{definition}

The set of algebraic numbers includes many familiar constants, such as $\sqrt{2}$ or $\frac{1}{2}$,
and plays a central role in number theory.
As it stands, the definition currently only states that it must be a root of some polynomial.
However, we can identify each algebraic number by one unique polynomial.

\begin{lemma}
  If $α$ is algebraic, then there exists a unique monic polynomial $m_α(X) ∈ ℚ[X]$
  of smallest degree with $α$ as a root.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
  For a contradiction, suppose there exists another monic polynomial $g(X) ≠
  m_α(X)$ with $\deg(g) = \deg(m_α)$.
  Then we can find polynomials $q(X), r(X) ∈ ℚ[X]$ such that
  \[
    g(X) = q(X) m_α(X) + r(X), \qquad \text{ with } r(X) = 0 \text{ or } \deg(r) < \deg(m_α).
  \]
  If $r(X) = 0$, then $q(X)$ has to have degree $0$.
  However, then either $q(X) = 1$, which means $m_α(X) = g(X)$ or one of
  the two polynomials is not monic.
  Both options would contradict our assumptions.

  Therefore, we must have $r(X) ≠ 0$.
  Because $m_α(α) = 0$ and $g(α) = 0$, we must also have $r(α) = 0$.
  However, then $r(X)$ would be a polynomial with smaller degree than $f(X)$
  and it would have $α$ as a root, which is a contradiction.
  Thus, $m_α$ is the unique monic polynomial for $α$.
\end{proof}

Every algebraic number is associated with a unique monic polynomial over the rational numbers
of minimal degree, known as its \emph{minimal polynomial}.
Since $m_α(α) = 0$,
we can think of $ℚ(α)$ as the set of rational polynomials in $α$ modulo $m_α$.
Therefore, any polynomial expression in $α$ with degree higher than $\deg(m_α)$
can be replaced by an expression with lower degree.
Hence, every element in $ℚ(α)$ can be expressed as
\[
  a₀ + a₁ α + ⋯ + a_{n-1} α^{n-1},
\]
where $n$ is the degree of the minimal polynomial $m_α$
and the coefficients $a₀, a₁, …, a_{n-1}$ are rational numbers.
Thus,
we can consider the field $ℚ(α)$ as a vector space over $ℚ$
with the set $\{1, α, …, α^{n-1}\}$ as a basis.
Then,
any element in $ℚ(α)$ can be expressed as a linear combination of this basis.
% TODO: Explain vector space over ℚ

\begin{definition}
  A field $K$ is an \emph{number field} if it is a finite extension of $ℚ$.
  The \emph{degree} of the number field $[K : ℚ]$ is defined as the dimension
  of $K$ as a vector space over $ℚ$.
\end{definition}

\begin{example}
  \hfill
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item The rational numbers form a number field and they have degree $1$.
    \item The quadratic field $ℚ(\sqrt{2})$ is a number field.
      Any element in $ ℚ(\sqrt{2})$ can be written as $a + b \sqrt{2}$ with $a,b ∈ ℚ$
      and it is therefore a number field with degree $[ℚ(\sqrt{2}) : ℚ] = 2$.
    \item The field $ℚ(\sqrt[3]{2})$ is a number field.
      It contains all elements of the form $a + b \sqrt[3]{2} + c \sqrt[3]{2^2}$ with $a,b,c ∈ ℚ$.
      Therefore, $1, \sqrt[3]{{2}}, \sqrt[3]{4}$ forms a basis for the vector space over $ℚ$
      and the field $ℚ(\sqrt[3]{2})$ has degree $[ℚ(\sqrt[3]{2}) : ℚ] = 3$.
  \end{enumerate}
\end{example}

Multiplication by a fixed element $α ∈ K$ of a number field $K$ can be viewed
as a linear transformation on its corresponding vector space.
For example, consider the field $ℚ(\sqrt{2})$ with basis $\{1, \sqrt{2}\}$
and one element $α = 1 + \sqrt{2}$.
Fixing this element, we can calculate the multiplication of $α$ with any $x = a
+ b \sqrt{2} ∈ ℚ(\sqrt{2})$ as follows:
\[
  αx = (1 + \sqrt{2})(a + b \sqrt{2}) = a + a \sqrt{2} + b \sqrt{2} + 2b = (a + 2b) + (a + b)\sqrt{2}.
\]
In the basis $\{1, \sqrt{2}\}$, this corresponds to the matrix
\[
  M_α =
  \begin{pmatrix}
    1 & 2 \\
    1 & 1
  \end{pmatrix}.
\]
This matrix can be defined for any element in any number field $K$.
We will make use of the determinant of this matrix:

\begin{definition}
  Let $K$ be a number field.
  The \emph{field norm} $N_{K/ℚ}(α)$ of an element $α$ of $K$ is defined as the
  determinant of its multiplication matrix $M_α$.
\end{definition}

An immediate consequence of the definition is multiplicativity:
the norm of a product is equal to the product of the norms.
This makes it a valuable tool for reasoning about algebraic equations
and for connecting the arithmetic of $K$ to that of $ℚ$.

\begin{lemma}
  For every $α, β ∈ K$, we have $N_{K/ℚ}(αβ) = N_{K/ℚ}(α) · N_{K/ℚ}(β)$.
\end{lemma}

\section{Lattices}
% ==============================================================================

This section is heavily based on the lecture notes by Rothvoss
\cite{Rothvoss23} and the book by Micciancio and Goldwasser~\cite{Micciancio02}.
We begin with the introduction of lattices.

One of the fundamental structures in linear algebra is the vector space.
Given a set of vectors $A = \{A_1, …, A_n\} ∈ ℝ^d$, the span of $A$ is the set
of all linear combinations of the basis vectors $A_i$.
A lattice is similarly defined over a set of vectors $A$, but instead of linear
combinations of vectors, a lattice consists of only integral linear
combinations.

% TODO: Should we allow real vectors?
\begin{definition}
  Let $A$ be an integer matrix with column vectors $A_1, \dots, A_n ∈ ℤ^d$.
  The \emph{lattice} generated by $A$ is defined as
  \[
    \mathcal{L}(A) = A ℤ^d
    = \left\{\, z_1 A_1 + \dots + z_n A_n \mid z_1, \dots, z_n \in ℤ \,\right\}.
  \]
  The \emph{rank} of $\mathcal{L}(A)$ is defined as the rank of the matrix $A$.
  The \emph{dimension} of the lattice is $d$.
  If $\mathrm{rank}(A) = d$,
  then $\mathcal{L}(A)$ is called a \emph{full-rank lattice} in $ℝ^d$,
  and the columns of $A$ form a \emph{basis} of the lattice.
\end{definition}

Different sets of column vectors can generate the same lattice.
That is, a lattice $L$ can have multiple different bases.
If two matrices $B, B' \in \mathbb{Z}^{d \times d}$ generate the same lattice,
then they must be related by a matrix $U \in \mathbb{Z}^{d \times d}$
such that
\[
  B' = BU.
\]
To ensure that $B$ and $B'$ generate exactly the same set of integer linear combinations,
the matrix $U$ must preserve volume and invertibility over $ℤ$.
This leads to the following definition.

\begin{definition}
  A matrix $U ∈ ℤ^{n×n}$ is \emph{unimodular} if $\det(U) = ±1$.
\end{definition}

\begin{lemma}
  If $U$ is unimodular, then $U^{-1}$ is unimodular.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
  We begin by showing that $U^{-1}$ consists of integer entries.
  Let $U^{(ij)}$ denote the matrix $U$ where the $i$-th column is replaced by the $j$-th unit vector $e_j$.
  Then, $\det(U^{(ij)}) ∈ ℤ$, and by Cramer's rule,
  \[
    U_{ij}^{-1} = \frac{\det(U^{(ij)})}{\det(U)}
  \]
  For the determinant, we have $\det(U^{-1}) = (\det(U))^{-1} = ±1$.
  Thus, the inverse $U^{-1}$ is unimodular.
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}
  \label{lem:unimodular}
  Let $B$ and $B'$ be two bases.
  The lattices $\mathcal L(B)$ and $\mathcal L(B')$ are the same if and only if
  there exists a unimodular matrix $U ∈ ℤ^{n×n}$ such that $B' = BU$.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
  Suppose $B' = BU$ for some unimodular matrix $U ∈ ℤ^{n×n}$.
  The function $f \colon ℤ^n → ℤ^n, f(x) = Ux$ is a bijection.
  Thus, any vector $y ∈ ℤ^n$ has a corresponding vector $x ∈ ℤ^n$ with $y = Ux$.
  Hence,
  \[
    \mathcal L(B)  = \{ B λ \mid λ ∈ ℤ^n \} = \{ B' U λ \mid λ ∈ ℤ^n \} = \mathcal L(B').
  \]

  Next, suppose $\mathcal L(B) = \mathcal L(B')$.
  Then, any vector in $B$ can be represented in a integral combination of the
  vectors of $B'$ and vice-versa.
  These coefficients can be combined into matrices $U, V ∈ ℤ^{n×n}$ such that $B' = BU$ and $B = B'V$.
  Thus, the determinant of $B$ is
  \[
    \det(B) = \det(BUV) = \det(B) \det(U) \det(V).
  \]
  Since $U$ and $V$ are both integer matrices,
  they must have determinant $±1$.
\end{proof}

\begin{figure}[tbp]

    and $B_2 = (1, 3)$.
    The fundamental parallelepiped $Π(B)$ is colored in {\color{cyan}cyan}.
  }
\end{figure}

While different bases may generate the same lattice, the geometric region they
span still captures the same volume and structure.
To study this structure more concretely, we consider the region formed by all
linear combinations of the basis vectors with coefficients in the unit
interval.
This region is a geometric representation of the “unit cell” of the lattice

\begin{definition}
  The \emph{fundamental parallelepiped} of a lattice $\mathcal{L}(B)$ with a basis $B ∈ ℤ^{d×d}$ is defined as
  \[
    Π(B) = \left\{\, B₁ x₁ + \dots + B_d x_d \mid x_1, \dots, x_d ∈ [0, 1) \,\right\}.
  \]
  The \emph{volume} of this parallelepiped is
  \[
    \mathrm{vol}(Π(B)) = |\det(B)|.
  \]
\end{definition}

A useful fact about the fundamental parallelepiped of a lattice $\mathcal L(B)$
is that if $B$ is a square integer matrix, then the volume of the
parallelepiped $Π(B)$ and the number of integer points $ℤ^n$ contained in
$Π(B)$ is entirely determined by $\mathrm{det}(B)$, i.e.
\[
  \mathrm{vol}(Π(B)) = |Π(B) ∩ ℤ^n| = |\det(B)|.
\]
