\chapter{Preliminaries}

In this thesis, we will consider real algebraic numbers which are roots of polynomials
\[
  p(x) = a_{d+1} x^{d+1} + a_d x^d + \dots + a_1 x + a_0
\]
with $aᵢ ∈ ℤ$ and $p$ is irreducible.

\begin{itemize}
  \item Quadratic fields as vector spaces
  \item Algebraic field extensions
  \item Monic polynomials, irreducible polynomials
  \item Rational expressions, polynomial rings
\end{itemize}

A rational expression of a number $α$ is a fraction of two polynomials, i.e.
\[
  \frac{p(α)}{q(α)} = \frac{pₙ x^n + \dots + p₁ x + p₀}{qₙ x^n + \dots + q₁ x + q₀}.
\]
The set of all rational expressions of an algebraic number $α$ is denoted as $ℚ(α)$.
