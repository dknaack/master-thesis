\section{Algebraic Number Theory}

In this thesis, we will consider real algebraic numbers which are roots of polynomials
\[
  p(x) = a_{d+1} x^{d+1} + a_d x^d + \dots + a_1 x + a_0
\]
with $aᵢ ∈ ℤ$ and $p$ is irreducible.

\begin{itemize}
  \item Quadratic fields as vector spaces
  \item Algebraic field extensions
  \item Monic polynomials, irreducible polynomials
  \item Rational expressions, polynomial rings
  \item the degree of a field extension $[K : L]$
  \item Finitely-generated field extensions
  \item Finite-degree field extensions
\end{itemize}

A rational expression of a number $α$ is a fraction of two polynomials, i.e.
\[
  \frac{p(α)}{q(α)} = \frac{pₙ α^n + \dots + p₁ α + p₀}{qₙ α^n + \dots + q₁ α + q₀}.
\]
The set of all rational expressions of an algebraic number $α$ is denoted as $ℚ(α)$.

\begin{definition}
  Let $L/K$ be a field extension and $α ∈ L$.
  If $α$ satisfies
  \[
    α^n + c_{n-1} α^{n-1} + ⋯ + c_1 α + c_0 = 0
  \]
  with $c₀, c₁, …, c_{n-1} ∈ K$,
  then $α$ is called \emph{algebraic over $K$}.
  Furthermore, if every $α ∈ L$ is \emph{algebraic over $K$}, then $L$ is called
  algebraic over $K$ and $L/K$ is an \emph{algebraic field extension}.
\end{definition}

Although, elements of a field $L$ can only be algebraic over another field $K$,
we will only look at elements which are algebraic over $ℚ$.
In this thesis, an \emph{algebraic number} will mean any number $x ∈ ℝ$, which
is algebraic over $ℚ$.

\begin{definition}
  Let $L/K$ be a field extension.
  The degree $[L : K]$ is defined as the dimension of the vector space $L$ over $K$.
  A field extension is finite if its degree $[L : K]$ is finite.
\end{definition}

A basis for this vector space would be $(1, α, …, α^{n-1})$, for example.

If we fix a particular element $α ∈ L$, then multiplication with $α$ is a linear operation:
\[
  M_α : L → L, M_α(x) = α · x.
\]

\begin{definition}
  Let $L/K$ be an algebraic field extension.
  The norm of an element $α ∈ L$ is defined as the determinant of $M_α$.
\end{definition}

\section{The Euclidean Algorithm}

\begin{Pseudocode}
algorithm Euclidean(a, b)
  while $b ≠ 0$ do
    $b' ← a \bmod b$ // modulo
    $(a, b) ← (b', a)$ // exchange
  end
  return $a$
end
\end{Pseudocode}

\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Modulo}: $b' ← a \bmod b$.
  \item \textbf{Exchange}: $(a, b) ← (b', a)$.
  \item \textbf{Termination}: $b = 0$
\end{itemize}

\begin{proposition}
  The ratio $b/a$ decreases by at least $1/2$ over two iterations.
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}
  Suppose $b/a > 1/2$ in the first iteration.
  Over two iterations, we have
  \[
    \frac{b}{a} · \frac{a \bmod b}{b}
    ≤ \frac{b}{a} · \frac{a - b}{b}
    = 1 - \frac{b}{a}
    < 1 - \frac{1}{2}
    = \frac{1}{2}.
  \]
  Therefore, it decreases by at least $1/2$ over two iterations.
\end{proof}

\begin{definition}
  The \emph{Fibonacci numbers} are defined as
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item $F(0) = F(1) = 1$.
    \item $F(n) = F(n - 1) + F(n - 2)$ for $n > 2$.
  \end{enumerate}
\end{definition}

\begin{proposition}[Lamé's Theorem \cite{Lame44}]
  The Euclidean algorithm requires at most $5h$ steps,
  where $h = \log_{10}(b)$.
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}
  \todo[inline]{Using Fibonacci numbers.}
\end{proof}

What if the ratio $a/b$ perfectly equals the golden ratio?
In this case, the Euclidean algorithm no longer runs on two integer inputs,
since the golden ratio is irrational.
Therefore, we extend the algorithm to the real numbers.
Our input now consists of a single number $x ∈ ℝ$, which in the original
algorithm represents the ratio between the two inputs.
This allows us to run the algorithm on the golden ratio.

Given $x ∈ ℝ$, the algorithm proceeds just as the original.
We assume $x$ actually represents the fraction $x/1$,
then we find a number $a₀ ∈ ℕ$ times until $x - 1 · a₀ < 1$.
Once this is the case, we swap the inputs, i.e. we calculate the inverse fraction $1/(x - a)$.
Now, we subtract $x - a$ from $1$ until $1 - a₁ (x - a₀) < x - a₀$
and then calculate the inverse fraction again.
We repeat this process until $x = 0$.
Subtracting $a_i$ from the numerator such that it is smaller than the
denominator and then calculating the inverse.

\begin{example}
  Let $x = 13/5$.
  The algorithm proceeds as follows:
  \[
    \begin{array}{rclcrcl}
      13/5 & = & 2 & · & 1   & + & 3/5 \\
         1 & = & 1 & · & 3/5 & + & 2/5 \\
       3/5 & = & 1 & · & 2/5 & + & 1/5 \\
       2/5 & = & 2 & · & 1/5 & + & 0.
    \end{array}
  \]
\end{example}

\begin{example}
  Let $φ$ be the golden ratio,
  i.e. $φ^2 - φ - 1 = 0$.
  The algorithm proceeds as follows:
  \[
    \begin{array}{rclcrcl}
      φ & = & 1 & · & 1   & + & φ - 1 \\
         1 & = & 1 & · & (φ - 1) & + & (2 - φ) \\
       φ - 1 & = & 1 & · & (2 - φ) & + & (2φ - 3) \\
       2 - φ & = & 1 & · & (2φ - 3) & + & (5 - 3φ) \\
       & \vdots &
    \end{array}
  \]
\end{example}


The real algorithm computes the coefficients of the continued fractions representation of $x$.
Continued fractions are fractions of the form
\[
  x = a_0 + \cfrac{1}{a_1 + \cfrac{1}{a_2 + \cfrac{1}{a_3 + \cfrac{1}{a_4 + \ddots}}}}.
\]
These fractions are denoted in the much more compact notation $x = [a₀; a₁, a₂, …]$.
Each continued fraction is usually defined of a sequence of integers $(a_n)_{n ≥ 0}$,
where all elements except the first are positive.
A continued fraction is finite, when its sequence $a_n$ is finite.
In this case, the continued fraction always represents a rational number.
