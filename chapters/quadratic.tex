\chapter{Periodic Representation of Quadratic Irrationals}

We begin with the case of quadratic irrationals.
A quadratic irrational is any real number which is a root of a polynomial with degree $2$.
For quadratic irrationals, it is already well known that they can be
represented using periodic continued fractions,
where continued fractions are fractions of the form
\[
  a₀ + \cfrac{1}{a₁ + \cfrac{1}{a₂ + \cfrac{1}{⋱}}}
\]
with $a₀ ∈ ℤ$ and $a₁, a₂, … ∈ ℤ_{> 0}$.
They are periodic when the sequence $a₀, a₁, a₂, …$ eventually repeats.
In this chapter we will prove that the continued fractions of a number are
periodic if and only if the number is a quadratic irrational.
Periodic continued fractions were first analyzed by Euler,
who has shown that such continued fractions must be quadratic irrationals.
Later, Lagrange \cite{Lagrange70} has proven the other direction, that
quadratic irrationals must always have periodic continued fractions.
For the proof, we require many properties from the continued fractions.
Specifically, we will show that continued fractions are always the best
rational approximation of a real number.
The continued fractions can also be interpreted geometrically.
This was initially proposed by Klein \cite{Klein95},
who viewed the continued fractions as points of a lattice.
A similar geometrical interpretation will be used in a later chapter for the
generalization of the continued fractions to higher dimensions.
His interpretation was also used to derive an analogue of Lagrange's theorem in
higher dimensions \cite{German08}. % TODO: Should this citation really be here?

\section{Continued Fractions}
% ==============================================================================

We begin with a more precise definition of what a continued fraction is and in
particular how infinite continued fractions are defined.
Although continued fractions are typically defined over a sequence of positive integers,
we extend the definition to allow for real numbers.
This will be useful for the theorems which follow.
In general, $r₀, r₁, …$ will denote a sequence of real numbers
and $a₀, a₁, …$ will denote a sequence of positive integers with the exception
of the first entry $a₀$, which can be any integer.

\begin{definition}
  Given a sequence $\{r_n\}_{n ≥ 0}$ of real numbers, the finite continued
  fractions over this sequence are defined inductively as
  \[
    [r₀] = r₀, \qquad
    [r₀; r₁, …, rₙ] = r₀ + \frac{1}{[r₁; r₂, …, rₙ]}.
  \]
  The infinite continued fraction $[r₀; r₁, r₂, …]$ is then defined if the limit
  \[
    r = \lim_{n → ∞} [r₀; r₁, …, rₙ]
  \]
  exists.
  The fractions $[r₀; r₁, …, rₙ]$ are called the
  \emph{convergents} of the infinite continued fraction $[r₀; r₁, r₂, …]$.
\end{definition}

If the sequence consists of positive integers,
then each convergent $[a₀; a₁, …, aₙ]$ has a unique rational value $pₙ/qₙ$.
This value can be calculated as follows:
For a convergent with only one entry, the convergent is simply $[a₀] = a₀ = a₀/1$.
The convergent of a longer fraction can be calculated by the following:
\[
  [a₀; a₁, …, aₙ]
  = a₀ + \frac{1}{[a₁; a₂, …, aₙ]}
  = a₀ + \frac{\tilde q_{n-1}}{\tilde p_{n-1}}
  = \frac{\tilde p_{n-1} a₀ + \tilde q_{n-1}}{\tilde p_{n-1}},
\]
where $\tilde p_{n-1} / \tilde q_{n-1}$ is the convergent of $[a₁; a₂, …, aₙ]$.

\begin{lemma}
  \label{lem:nesting}
  Let $x ∈ ℝ$, then
  \[
    [a₀; a₁, …, a_n, x] = [a₀; a₁, …, a_n + 1/x]
  \]
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
  If $n = 0$, then
  \[
    [a₀; x] = a₀ + \frac{1}{[x]} = a₀ + \frac{1}{x} = [a₀ + 1/x].
  \]
  Suppose the lemma is true for some $n ≥ 0$, then
  \begin{align*}
    [a₀; a₁, …, aₙ, x]
    & = a₀ + \frac{1}{[a₁; a₂, …, aₙ, x]} \\
    & = a₀ + \frac{1}{[a₁; a₂, …, aₙ + 1/x]} \\
    & = [a₀; a₁, …, aₙ, x]. \qedhere
  \end{align*}
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}
  \label{lem:cf-wallis}
  Let $x ∈ ℝ$, then
  \[
    [a₀; a₁, …, a_{n-1}, x] = \frac{p_{n-1} x + p_{n-2}}{q_{n-1} x + q_{n-2}}.
  \]
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
  If $n = 0$, then
  \[
    [x] = x = \frac{1x + 0}{0x + 1} = \frac{p_{-1} x + p_{-2}}{q_{-1} x + q_{-2}}.
  \]
  Suppose, the lemma is true for $n ≥ 0$.
  By Lemma~\ref{lem:nesting}, we have
  \begin{align*}
    [a₀; a₁, …, aₙ, x]
    & = [a₀; a₁, …, aₙ + 1/x].
  \end{align*}
  From the induction hypothesis, it follows that
  \begin{align*}
    [a₀; a₁, …, aₙ + 1/x]
    & = \frac{p_{n - 1} (aₙ + 1/x) + p_{n-2}}{q_{n-1} (aₙ + 1/x) + q_{n-2}} \\
    & = \frac{x (p_{n-1} aₙ + p_{n-2}) + p_{n-1}}{x (q_{n-1} aₙ + q_{n-2}) + q_{n-1}} \\
    & = \frac{pₙ x + p_{n-1}}{qₙ x + q_{n-1}}. \qedhere
  \end{align*}
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}
  \label{lem:cf-det}
  $p_n q_{n-1} - q_n p_{n-1} = (-1)^n$.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}

\end{proof}

\section{Construction of Continued Fractions}
% ==============================================================================

% TODO: Should we jump out of the gate with this problem?
For a representation of the real numbers,
we need to construct a unique continued fractions for every number $x ∈ ℝ$.
Although the definition of a continued fraction allows real numbers,
for the construction we restrict ourselves to continued fractions which only
contain integers.
More specifically, we will only look at continued fractions $[a₀; a₁, a₂, …]$
with $a₀ ∈ ℤ$ and $aₙ ∈ ℤ_{> 0}$.
However, this does not guarantee a unique representation alone.
Consider $x = 3/2$, with the current requirements there are two possible representations:
\[
  x = [1; 1, 1] = 1 + \cfrac{1}{1 + \cfrac{1}{1}} \qquad \text{ or } \qquad x = [1; 2] = 1 + \cfrac{1}{2}.
\]
The issue is that we can always split the last coefficient in the continued fraction.
In general, if $x = [a₀; a₁, …, aₙ]$, then also $x = [a₀; a₁, …, aₙ - 1, 1]$.
Therefore, we additionally require that in a finite continued fraction the last value is never $1$.

To construct a continued fraction for a particular number $x ∈ ℝ$,
we use the Euclidean algorithm.
For a rational number $x = p/q$ we can run the algorithm
on the inputs $(p, q)$.
Recall that the Euclidean algorithm runs in two steps: modulo and exchange.
The modulo step removes the integer part of the fraction $p/q$
and the exchange step swaps the numerator with the denominator,
or equivalently it inverts the fraction.

\begin{example}
  Consider $x = 13/5$.
  The Euclidean algorithm computes
  \begin{align*}
    13 & = 2 · 5 + 3 \\
     5 & = 1 · 3 + 2 \\
     3 & = 1 · 2 + 1 \\
     2 & = 2 · 1 + 0.
  \end{align*}
  The factors in each line correspond directly to the continued fraction of $13/5$:
  \[
    \frac{13}{5}
    = [2; 1, 1, 2]
    = 2 + \cfrac{1}{1 + \cfrac{1}{1 + \cfrac{1}{2}}}
    = 2 + \cfrac{1}{1 + \cfrac{2}{3}}
    = 2 + \cfrac{3}{5}
    = \frac{13}{5}.
  \]
\end{example}

\begin{theorem}
  \label{thm:rat-cf}
  Every rational number has a finite continued fraction representation.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
  Let $p/q$ be a reduced fraction, i.e. $\gcd(p, q) = 1$.
  The proof is done by induction over the number of steps when running the
  Euclidean algorithm on $(p, q)$.
  Suppose only one step is required, then $p = a₀ q + 0$.
  Because $p/q$ is reduced, $q = 1$ and $p/q$ is an integer.
  Hence, $[a₀] = a₀ = p$ is a valid continued fraction of $p/q$.
  For $n ≥ 0$, let $p = a₀ q + r$ be the first step of the Euclidean algorithm.
  By induction, suppose that $q/r$ has a finite continued fraction $[a₁; a₂, …, aₙ]$.
  Then,
  \[
    \frac{p}{q}
    = a₀ + \frac{r}{q}
    = a₀ + \frac{1}{\frac{r}{q}}
    = a₀ + \frac{1}{[a₁; a₂, …, aₙ]}
    = [a₀; a₁, …, aₙ].
  \]
  Therefore, there exists a continued fraction for every rational number $p/q$.
\end{proof}

For the continued fractions of irrational numbers,
we extend the Euclidean algorithm to allow real numbers as input.
The algorithm still works the same.
The modulo step subtracts the smaller number from the larger until it is no
longer possible and the exchange step swaps the two inputs.
This time, there is no immediately apparent way to split an irrational number
$x$ into two inputs $(a, b)$.
However, a simple solution is to use $(x, 1)$ as the input to the Euclidean
algorithm.
In fact, for the rational numbers we similarly could have used $(p/q, 1)$ as
the input.

% TODO: We should probably use a simpler example
\begin{example}
  Consider $x = \sqrt{7}$.
  The Euclidean algorithm proceeds as follows:
  \[
    \begin{array}{rclcrcl}
      \sqrt{7}      & = & 2 · 1               + (\sqrt{7} - 2)    & ≈ & 2.6458 & = & 2 · 1 + 0.6458      \\
      1             & = & 1 · (\sqrt{7} - 2)  + (3 - \sqrt{7})    & ≈ & 1      & = & 1 · 0.6458 + 0.3542 \\
      \sqrt{7} - 2  & = & 1 · (3 - \sqrt{7})  + (2\sqrt{7} - 5)   & ≈ & 0.6458 & = & 1 · 0.3542 + 0.2915 \\
      3 - \sqrt{7}  & = & 1 · (2\sqrt{7} - 5) + (8 - 3\sqrt{7})   & ≈ & 0.3542 & = & 1 · 0.2915 + 0.0627 \\
      2\sqrt{7} - 5 & = & 4 · (8 - 3\sqrt{7}) + (14\sqrt{7} - 37) & ≈ & 0.2915 & = & 4 · 0.0627 + 0.0407 \\
                    & ⋮ &                                         & ⋮ &        & ⋮ &
    \end{array}
  \]
  This corresponds to the continued fraction $\sqrt{7} = [2; 1, 1, 1, 4, …]$.
\end{example}

\begin{example}
  Consider the golden ratio $φ$.
  It is the positive real root of the polynomial $p(x) = x^2 - x - 1$,
  which means that it satisfies $φ = 1 + 1/φ$.
  This makes the construction of the continued fraction particularly simple since
  \[
    φ = 1 + \cfrac{1}{1 + \cfrac{1}{1 + \cfrac{1}{⋱}}}.
  \]
  So the golden ratio $φ$ is represented by $[1; \overline{1}]$.
\end{example}

For the golden ratio, there is also a geometric interpretation via the golden
rectangle as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:golden-rectangle}.
The golden rectangle has side lengths of $1$ and $φ$,
and the Euclidean algorithm tries to remove as many unit squares inside the
golden rectangle as possible.
In this case, only one square is removed
and we get a new rectangle with side lengths $1$ and $φ - 1$.
But the ratios between the longer and shorter sides remain the same since
\[
  φ^2 - φ - 1 = 0 ⇔ φ(φ - 1) = 1 ⇔ \frac{φ}{1} = \frac{1}{φ - 1}.
\]
Therefore, in the next rectangle only one square of length $φ - 1$ will be
removed again.

\begin{lemma}
  \label{lem:cf-approx}
  Let $p_n/q_n$ be the convergents of $x ∈ ℝ$, then
  \[
    \left| x - \frac{pₙ}{qₙ} \right| < \frac{1}{qₙ^2}.
  \]
\end{lemma}

% TODO: Have we proven that (p_{n-1} q_n - p_n q_{n-1}) = (-1)^n yet?
\begin{proof}
  Suppose $x = [a₀; a₁, …, a_{n-1}, xₙ]$ for some $xₙ ∈ ℝ$ and $pₙ/qₙ = [a₀; a₁, …, a_{n-1}, aₙ]$ with $aₙ = \floor{xₙ}$.
  By Lemma~\ref{lem:cf-wallis},
  \begin{align*}
    \left| x - \frac{pₙ}{qₙ} \right|
    & = \left| \frac{x_n p_{n-1} + p_{n-2}}{x_n q_{n-1} + q_{n-2}} - \frac{a_n p_{n-1} + p_{n-2}}{a_n q_{n-1} + q_{n-2}} \right| \\
    & = \left| \frac{(x_n p_{n-1} + p_{n-2})(a_n q_{n-1} + q_{n-2}) - (x_n q_{n-1} + q_{n-2})(a_n p_{n-1} + p_{n-2})}{(x_n q_{n-1} + q_{n-2})(a_n q_{n-1} + q_{n-2})} \right| \\
    & = \left| \frac{(p_{n-1} q_{n-2} + q_{n-1} p_{n-2})(x_n - a_n)}{((x_n - a_n) q_{n-1} + q_n) q_n} \right| \\
    & = \Biggl| \frac{(-1)^{n+1} \overbrace{(x_n - a_n)}^{≤ 1}}{q_n^2 + \underbrace{(x_n - a_n)}_{≥ 0} q_{n-1} q_n} \Biggr| < \frac{1}{q_n^2}. \qedhere
  \end{align*}
\end{proof}

\begin{theorem}
  \label{thm:irrat-cf}
  Every irrational number has a unique continued fraction.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
  From the previous lemma it follows that $[a₀; a₁, …] = \lim_{n → ∞} [a₀; a₁, …, aₙ] = x$.
  Suppose there is a different sequence $\{b_n\}_{n ≥ 0}$ with $[b₀; b₁, …] = x$.
  % TODO
  Therefore, the sequence $\{aₙ\}_{n ≥ 0}$ is unique.

\section{Continued Fractions of Quadratic Irrationals}
% ==============================================================================

\begin{definition}
  A continued fraction $[a₀; a₁, …]$ is called \emph{eventually periodic}
  if there exists an index $K ≥ 0$ and a period $ℓ ≥ 1$ such that $aₖ = a_{k+ℓ}$ for every $k ≥ K$.
  A continued fraction is called \emph{purely periodic} if $k₀ = 0$.
\end{definition}

For a periodic continued fraction starting at $K$ with length $ℓ$,
we will denote it as $[a₀; a₁, …, a_{K-1}, \overline{a_K, …, a_{K+ℓ}}]$.
This is similar to how in decimal notation, we denote a period with a bar over the digits.
For example, $1/3 = 0.\overline{3}$.

\begin{example}
  Consider $x = \sqrt{2}$.
  We can rewrite $x$ as follows:
  \begin{align*}
    x
    = 1 + (\sqrt{2} - 1)
    = 1 + (\sqrt{2} - 1) \frac{(1 + \sqrt{2})}{1 + \sqrt{2}}
    = 1 + \frac{1}{1 + \sqrt{2}}
  \end{align*}
  Expanding $\sqrt{2}$ in the equation infinitely many times gives us
  \begin{align*}
    \sqrt{2}
    = 1 + \frac{1}{2 + \cfrac{1}{2 + \cfrac{1}{2 + \cfrac{1}{⋱}}}}.
  \end{align*}
  So the continued fraction of $\sqrt{2}$ is $[1; \overline{2}]$.
\end{example}

The interesting connection between the quadratic irrationals and continued
fraction is that a continued fraction of a number $x ∈ ℝ$ is eventually
periodic if and only if $x$ is a quadratic irrational.
We begin with the first direction:

\begin{theorem}
  If the continued fraction representation of a number $x ∈ ℝ$ is eventually periodic,
  then $x$ is a quadratic irrational.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
  Let $x$ be a continued fraction $[a₀; a₁, …]$ with a period of length $ℓ ≥ 1$
  starting at an index $k ≥ 0$,
  i.e. $x_k = [a_k; a_{k+1}, …] = [a_{k+ℓ}; a_{k+ℓ+1}, …] = x_{k+ℓ}$.
  By Lemma~\ref{lem:cf-wallis}, we have
  \[
    x
    = \frac{p_k x_k + p_{k-1}}{q_k x_k + q_{k-1}}
    = \frac{p_{k+ℓ} x_{k+ℓ} + p_{k+ℓ-1}}{q_{k+ℓ} x_{k+ℓ} + q_{k+ℓ-1}}
    = \frac{p_{k+ℓ} x_k + p_{k+ℓ-1}}{q_{k+ℓ} x_k + q_{k+ℓ-1}}
  \]
  Multiplying by the denominators on both sides results in the quadratic equation
  \[
    (q_{k+ℓ} x_k + q_{k+ℓ-1})(p_k x_k + p_{k-1}) - (q_k x_k + q_{k-1}) (p_{k+ℓ} x_k + p_{k+ℓ-1}) = 0.
  \]
  Hence, the complete quotient $x_k$ is a quadratic irrational and
  since $x$ is a rational expression of $x_k$ it must also be a quadratic irrational.
\end{proof}

The converse was originally proven by Lagrange \cite{Lagrange70}.

\begin{theorem}
  If $x$ is a quadratic irrational,
  then its continued fraction is periodic.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
  Let $x$ be a quadratic irrational which satisfies $ax^2 + bx + c = 0$.
  Furthermore, let $x = [a₀; a₁, a₂, …]$ and $x_n = [a_n; a_{n+1}, …]$ for every $n ≥ 0$.
  By Lemma~\ref{lem:cf-wallis}, we must have
  \[
    a \left(\frac{x_n p_{n-1} + p_{n-2}}{x_n q_{n-1} + q_{n-2}}\right)^2
    + b \left(\frac{x_n p_{n-1} + p_{n-2}}{x_n q_{n-1} + q_{n-2}}\right)
    + c = 0.
  \]
  We rearrange the polynomial into the form
  \[
    A_n x_n^2 + B_n x_n + C_n = 0
  \]
  with
  \begin{align*}
    A_n & = a p_{n-1}^2 + b p_{n-1} q_{n-1} + c q_{n-1}^2, \\
    B_n & = 2a p_{n-1} p_{n-2} + b p_{n-1} q_{n-2} + b p_{n-2} q_{n-1} + 2c q_{n-1} q_{n-2}, \\
    C_n & = a p_{n-2}^2 + b p_{n-2} q_{n-2} + c q_{n-2}^2 = A_{n-1}.
  \end{align*}
  The goal is to show that $A_n, B_n, C_n$ are bounded independently of $n$.
  First, we note that the discriminant $D_n = B_n^2 - 4 A_n C_n$ is still $b^2 - 4ac$.
  If $A_n$ and $C_n$ are bounded, then $B_n$ is bounded.
  Furthermore, since $C_n = A_{n-1}$, it suffices to show that $A_n$ is bounded.

  By Lemma~\ref{lem:cf-approx}, we have
  \[
    \left| x - \frac{p_{n-1}}{q_{n-1}} \right| < \frac{1}{q_{n-1}^2}
    \Rightarrow
    p_{n-1} = q_{n-1} x + \frac{δ_{n-1}}{q_{n-1}}, \quad \text{ for some } |δ_{n-1}| < 1,
  \]
  from which it follows that
  \begin{align*}
    A_n & = a p_{n-1}^2 + b p_{n-1} q_{n-1} + c q_{n-1}^2, \\
    & = a \left( q_{n-1} x + \frac{δ_{n-1}}{q_{n-1}} \right)^2 + b \left( q_{n-1} x + \frac{δ_{n-1}}{q_{n-1}} \right) q_{n-1} + c q_{n-1}^2 \\
    & = \underbrace{(ax^2 + bx + c)}_{ = 0} q_{n-1}^2 + (2ax + b) δ_{n-1} + a \frac{δ_{n-1}^2}{q_{n-1}^2}.
  \end{align*}
  This allows us to bound $A_n$ by
  \begin{align*}
    |A_n| ≤ 2|a||x| + |b| + |a| = (2 |x| + 1) |a| + |b|.
  \end{align*}
  Because $C_n = A_{n-1}$ and the discriminant $D_n$ stays the same, we can
  bound $B_n$ by
  \begin{align*}
    B_n^2 ≤ D_k + 4 |A_n| |C_n| ≤ b^2 + 4 |a| |c| + ((2 |x| + 1)|a| + |b|)^2.
  \end{align*}

  We have shown that for every polynomial the coefficients $A_n, B_n, C_n$ are all bounded,
  therefore there must be some triple $(A_n, B_n, C_n)$ which repeats.
  But the construction of the continued fraction is the same for the same polynomials.
  Hence, the continued fraction of $x$ must be eventually periodic.
\end{proof}

\section{The Geometry behind Continued Fractions}
% ==============================================================================

With the prospect of the generalized Euclidean algorithm, I present a geometric
proof based on Klein \cite{Klein95}.
The basis behind this proof is that instead of viewing the convergents $p_n/q_n$ as
fractions on a 1-dimensional number line,
we view them as two dimensional integer vectors $B_n$, where the first coordinate
represents the numerator $p$ and the second coordinate the denominator $q$.

From Lemma~\ref{lem:cf-wallis},
we directly know that the vectors $B_n$ can be calculated as follows:
\begin{align*}
  B_n =
  \begin{pmatrix}
    p_n \\ q_n
  \end{pmatrix}
  =
  \begin{pmatrix}
    p_{n-1} \\ q_{n-1}
  \end{pmatrix}
  a_n
  +
  \begin{pmatrix}
    p_{n-2} \\ q_{n-2}
  \end{pmatrix}
  = B_{n-1} a_n + B_{n-2}
\end{align*}

\begin{figure}[tb]
  \centering
  \includestandalone{figures/critical-section}
  \caption{
    The hyperbolas each contain only elements with norm $±1$.
    The red area could contain an integral point, in which case this point
    would be closer than the initial point.
    The gray area cannot contain an integral point since the norm would be
    fractional.
  }
\end{figure}

\begin{figure}[tb]
  \centering
  \includestandalone{figures/parallelogram-cover}
  \caption{
    The parallelogram spanned by $B$ and $B'$ contains only $0$ as an integral point.
    The rest of the surface can be covered by identical parallelograms.
    Therefore, the surface can only contain an integral point at $B$.
  }
\end{figure}

We can also begin with a real number $x$ and find its continued fraction using
the vector representation.
We map the vector $x$ to its homogeneous version $\hat x = (x, 1)$.
To find the continued fraction for $x$,
we subtract the integer part $a = \floor{x}$ and invert the fraction.
In the vector representation, this amounts to a translation $T$ of the vector in
the first coordinate and a swap $S$ of the coordinates.
These operations are done with the two matrices:
\begin{align*}
  T_a = \begin{pmatrix}
    1 & a \\
    0 & 1 \\
  \end{pmatrix},
  S = \begin{pmatrix}
    0 & 1 \\
    1 & 0 \\
  \end{pmatrix}
\end{align*}

Importantly, both operations are unimodular; they do not change the underlying lattice.

\begin{align*}
  B_n & = T^{a₀} S T^{a₁} S T^{a₂} … S T^{aₙ} B_1 \\
  & = T^{a₀} \underbrace{S T^{a₁} S}_{S_2^{a_1}} T^{a₂} … S T^{aₙ} B_1
\end{align*}

\begin{align*}
  S_2^a = R S_1 \underbrace{R R}_{I} S_1 \underbrace{R R}_I S_1\, R … R\, S_1 R = R S_1^{a} R.
\end{align*}

\begin{definition}
  A point $(x, y)$ is a \emph{relative minimum} with respect to a line $x - α y = 0$,
  if for every point $(x', y')$ with $x' ≤ x$ \emph{or} $y' ≤ y$, we have
  \[
    |x - α y| ≤ |x' - α y'|.
  \]
\end{definition}

\begin{lemma}
  Every convergent is a relative minimum.
\end{lemma}

\begin{lemma}
  Every relative minimum is a convergent.
\end{lemma}

If we can find an infinite sequence of points $A₁, A₂, …$
such that for every $n ≥ 0$, $A_n = U^n A_1$ for some unimodular matrix $U$
and $A_n$ is a relative minimum,
then the continued fraction must be periodic.
To find these numbers, we turn to Pell's equation.
Pell's equation is defined as
\[
  x^2 - n y^2 = 1.
\]
A trivial solution is $x = 1, y = 0$.
However, we are interested in non-trivial solutions and the following lemma
shows that the equation does have such solutions.

\begin{lemma}
  There are non-trivial integral points which satisfy Pell's equation.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}

\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}
  Every integral point of Pell's equation is a relative minimum.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}

\end{proof}

\begin{theorem}
  If $x$ is a quadratic irrational,
  then the continued fraction of $x$ is eventually periodic.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
  By the previous lemma, all units $ε_n$ are relative minima.
  There exists a matrix $U$ with unit determinant such that $ε_{n+1} = U^n ε_1$.
  Therefore, the transformation by the continued fractions must also be the same between every unit.
  With the continued fractions, we can only use the positive matrices $T$ and
  $S$ to reach another positive matrix $U$.
  There can only be finitely many possible multiplications to reach $U$.
  Therefore, the coefficients $a₁, a₂, a₃, …$ must repeat at some point.
\end{proof}
