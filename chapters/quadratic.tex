\chapter{Continued Fractions}
\label{ch:quadratic}

% TODO: Find a source for this chapter
We begin with the case of quadratic irrationals.
A quadratic irrational is any real number which is a root of a polynomial with degree $2$.
For quadratic irrationals, it is already well known that they can be
represented using periodic continued fractions,
where continued fractions are fractions of the form
\[
  a₀ + \cfrac{1}{a₁ + \cfrac{1}{a₂ + \cfrac{1}{⋱}}}
\]
with $a₀ ∈ ℤ$ and $a₁, a₂, … ∈ ℤ_{> 0}$.
They are periodic when the sequence $a₀, a₁, a₂, …$ eventually repeats.
In this chapter we will prove that the continued fractions of a number are
periodic if and only if the number is a quadratic irrational.
Periodic continued fractions were first analyzed by Euler,
who has shown that such continued fractions must be quadratic irrationals.
Later, Lagrange \cite{Lagrange70} has proven the other direction, that
quadratic irrationals must always have periodic continued fractions.
For the proof, we require many properties from the continued fractions.
Specifically, we will show that continued fractions are always the best
rational approximations of a real number.
The continued fractions can also be interpreted geometrically.
This was initially proposed by Klein \cite{Klein95},
who viewed the continued fractions as points of a lattice.
A similar geometrical interpretation will be used in a later chapter for the
generalization of the continued fractions to higher dimensions.

\section{Definition and Basic Properties}
% ==============================================================================

We begin with a more precise definition of what a continued fraction is and in
particular how infinite continued fractions are defined.
Although continued fractions are typically defined over a sequence of positive integers,
we extend the definition to allow for real numbers.
This will be useful for the theorems which follow.
In general, $r₀, r₁, …$ will denote a sequence of real numbers
and $a₀, a₁, …$ will denote a sequence of positive integers with the exception
of the first entry $a₀$, which can be any integer.

\begin{definition}
  Given a sequence $(r_n)_{n ≥ 0}$ of real numbers, the finite continued
  fractions over this sequence are defined inductively as
  \[
    [r₀] = r₀, \qquad
    [r₀; r₁, …, rₙ] = r₀ + \frac{1}{[r₁; r₂, …, rₙ]}.
  \]
  The infinite continued fraction $[r₀; r₁, r₂, …]$ is then defined if the limit
  \[
    r = \lim_{n → ∞} [r₀; r₁, …, rₙ]
  \]
  exists.
  The fraction $[r₀; r₁, …, rₖ]$ is also called the \emph{$k$-th convergent} of $[r₀; r₁, …, r_n]$.
\end{definition}

If the sequence consists of positive integers,
then each convergent $[a₀; a₁, …, aₙ]$ has a unique rational value $pₙ/qₙ$.
This value can be calculated as follows:
For a convergent with only one entry, the convergent is simply $[a₀] = a₀ = a₀/1$.
The convergent of a longer fraction can be calculated by the following:
\[
  [a₀; a₁, …, aₙ]
  = a₀ + \frac{1}{[a₁; a₂, …, aₙ]}
  = a₀ + \frac{\tilde q_{n-1}}{\tilde p_{n-1}}
  = \frac{\tilde p_{n-1} a₀ + \tilde q_{n-1}}{\tilde p_{n-1}},
\]
where $\tilde p_{n-1} / \tilde q_{n-1}$ is the convergent of $[a₁; a₂, …, aₙ]$.
Of course, this requires calculating a convergent of a different continued
fraction.
Instead, we can use a more direct way to calculate the convergent $pₙ/qₙ$ from
the previous convergents $p_{n-1}/q_{n-1}$ and $p_{n-2}/q_{n-2}$ of the same
continued fractions.
To prove this, we will first need the following lemma,
which shows that we can also start from the back of a continued fraction.

\begin{lemma}
  \label{lem:cf-nesting}
  Let $r₀, r₁, …, r_n, x ∈ ℝ$, then
  \[
    [r₀; r₁, …, r_n, x] = [r₀; r₁, …, r_n + 1/x]
  \]
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
  If $n = 0$, then
  \[
    [r₀; x] = r₀ + \frac{1}{[x]} = r₀ + \frac{1}{x} = [r₀ + 1/x].
  \]
  Suppose the lemma is true for some $n ≥ 0$, then
  \begin{align*}
    [r₀; r₁, …, rₙ, x]
    & = r₀ + \frac{1}{[r₁; r₂, …, rₙ, x]} \\
    & = r₀ + \frac{1}{[r₁; r₂, …, rₙ + 1/x]} \\
    & = [r₀; a₁, …, rₙ, x]. \qedhere
  \end{align*}
\end{proof}

We can use the following recurrence relation to calculate the convergent $p_n/q_n$:
\begin{align*}
  p_n & = p_{n-1} r_n + p_{n-2}, & p_{-1} & = 1, & p_{-2} & = 0, \\
  q_n & = q_{n-1} r_n + q_{n-2}, & q_{-1} & = 1, & q_{-2} & = 0.
\end{align*}
The correctness is shown by the following lemma.

\begin{lemma}
  \label{lem:cf-wallis}
  Let $x ∈ ℝ$, then
  \[
    [a₀; a₁, …, a_{n-1}, x] = \frac{pₙ}{qₙ} = \frac{p_{n-1} x + p_{n-2}}{q_{n-1} x + q_{n-2}}.
  \]
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
  If $n = 0$, then
  \[
    [x] = x = \frac{1x + 0}{0x + 1} = \frac{p_{-1} x + p_{-2}}{q_{-1} x + q_{-2}}.
  \]
  Suppose, the lemma is true for $n ≥ 0$.
  By Lemma~\ref{lem:cf-nesting}, we have
  \begin{align*}
    [a₀; a₁, …, aₙ, x]
    & = [a₀; a₁, …, aₙ + 1/x].
  \end{align*}
  From the induction hypothesis, it follows that
  \begin{align*}
    [a₀; a₁, …, aₙ + 1/x]
    & = \frac{p_{n - 1} (aₙ + 1/x) + p_{n-2}}{q_{n-1} (aₙ + 1/x) + q_{n-2}} \\
    & = \frac{x (p_{n-1} aₙ + p_{n-2}) + p_{n-1}}{x (q_{n-1} aₙ + q_{n-2}) + q_{n-1}} \\
    & = \frac{pₙ x + p_{n-1}}{qₙ x + q_{n-1}}. \qedhere
  \end{align*}
\end{proof}

\section{Construction using the Euclidean Algorithm}
% ==============================================================================

% TODO: Should we jump out of the gate with this problem?
The first part of Hermite's question requires a representation of the real numbers.
This means we have to find a unique continued fraction $[r₀; r₁, …]$ for every real number $x$.
Although we have allowed real numbers in them so far,
we will now restrict them to only integer coefficients.
More specifically, we will only look at continued fractions $[a₀; a₁, a₂, …]$
where the first coefficient $a₀$ can be any integer but the remaining ones have to be positive.
These constraints do not guarantee a unique representation alone.
Consider $x = 3/2$, with the current requirements there are two possible representations:
\[
  x = [1; 1, 1] = 1 + \cfrac{1}{1 + \cfrac{1}{1}} \qquad \text{ or } \qquad x = [1; 2] = 1 + \cfrac{1}{2}.
\]
The issue is that we can always split the last coefficient in the continued fraction.
In general, if $x = [a₀; a₁, …, aₙ]$, then also $x = [a₀; a₁, …, aₙ - 1, 1]$.
Therefore, we additionally require that in a finite continued fraction the last value is never $1$.

We begin with the representation of rational numbers.
We use the Euclidean algorithm to construct the continued fraction for a number $x ∈ ℚ$,
More specifically, if $x = p/q$, then we run the algorithm with the input pair $(p, q)$.
At each step, we keep track of the quotient,
which will be used as a coefficient in the continued fraction.
So if we calculate $p = a₀q + r$ in the first division step, then the quotient $a₀$ will be
the first coefficient in the continued fraction $[a₀; a₁, …, aₙ]$ for $p/q$.
This is also the reason why we allow $a₀$ to be negative.
If the fraction $p/q$ is negative, then $a₀$ is negative, too.

\begin{example}
  Consider $x = 13/5$.
  The Euclidean algorithm computes
  \begin{align*}
    13 & = 2 · 5 + 3 \\
     5 & = 1 · 3 + 2 \\
     3 & = 1 · 2 + 1 \\
     2 & = 2 · 1 + 0.
  \end{align*}
  The quotient in each line correspond directly to the continued fraction of $13/5$:
  \[
    \frac{13}{5}
    = [2; 1, 1, 2]
    = 2 + \cfrac{1}{1 + \cfrac{1}{1 + \cfrac{1}{2}}}
    = 2 + \cfrac{1}{1 + \cfrac{2}{3}}
    = 2 + \cfrac{3}{5}
    = \frac{13}{5}.
  \]
\end{example}

\begin{lemma}
  \label{lem:cf-rat}
  Every rational number has a finite continued fraction.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
  Let $p/q$ be the reduced fraction of a rational number, i.e. $\gcd(p, q) = 1$.
  We proceed by induction over the number of steps when running the
  Euclidean algorithm on $(p, q)$.
  Suppose only one step is required, then $p = a₀ q + 0$.
  Because $\gcd(p, q) = 1$, the fraction $p/q$ must be an integer.
  Hence, the continued fraction $[a₀]$ represents $p/q$ correctly.

  Next, suppose that there exists a valid continued fraction for any rational
  number which requires $n$ steps in the Euclidean algorithm.
  Let $p = a₀ q + r$ be the first step of the Euclidean algorithm
  and suppose $(p, q)$ requires $n+1$ steps.
  Then, $(q, r)$ requires $n$ steps and by induction there exists a continued
  fraction $[a₁; a₂, …, aₙ]$ for $q/r$.
  Using this fact, we can construct the continued fraction for $p/q$, since
  \[
    \frac{p}{q}
    = a₀ + \frac{r}{q}
    = a₀ + \frac{1}{\frac{r}{q}}
    = a₀ + \frac{1}{[a₁; a₂, …, aₙ]}
    = [a₀; a₁, …, aₙ].
  \]
  Therefore, $[a₀; a₁, …, aₙ]$ is a valid continued fraction for $p/q$.
\end{proof}

So for every rational number, we have a finite continued fraction.
It remains to be shown that there exists a continued fraction for every irrational number.
However, we cannot use the Euclidean algorithm again.
In order to run the Euclidean algorithm for an irrational number $x$,
we would have to find two integers $p, q$ such that $p/q = x$
and that is by definition not possible.
Therefore, we cannot use the Euclidean algorithm directly to construct a
continued fraction.

Instead, we use a slightly different algorithm shown in Listing~\ref{lst:cont-frac}.
The algorithm is adapted from the Euclidean algorithm.
It only receives a single number $x$ and calculates the continued fraction $[a₀; a₁, …]$ for this number.
It begins with $x₀ = x$ and computes the integer part $\floor{x₀}$,
which will be the first coefficient.
Then, it continues with $x₁ = 1/\{x₀\}$.
These steps are repeated until $xₙ = 0$.
The terms $x_n$ are also called the \emph{$n$-th complete quotient} of $x$.

\begin{example}
  % TODO: Example for an irrational number.
\end{example}

Because the continued fraction $[a₀; a₁, …]$ is made up of integers and the
ones after $a₀$ are all positive, its integer part is entirely determined by
the first coefficient $a₀$ and its fractional part is determined by $[0; a₁, a₂, …]$.

\begin{Pseudocode}[
    float={tbp},
    label={lst:cont-frac},
    caption={Algorithm to construct a continued fraction {$[a₀; a₁, …]$} for any $x ∈ ℝ$.}]
$x₀ ← x$
$n ← 0$
while $xₙ ≠ 0$ do
  $aₙ ← \floor{xₙ}$
  $x_{n+1} ← \frac{1}{xₙ - aₙ}$
  $n ← n + 1$
end
\end{Pseudocode}

\begin{lemma}
  Let $n ≥ 1$ and $a₁, …, aₙ ∈ \Z_{> 0}$.
  Then, $[0; a₁, …, aₙ] < 1$.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
  For $n = 1$, the continued fraction is $[0; a₁] = \frac{1}{a₁}$.
  Because $a₁ ≥ 2$, the whole continued fraction must be smaller than $1$.
  Suppose that $[0; a₂, …, aₙ]$ is smaller than $1$.
  Then the inverse is smaller than $1$ but still greater than $0$.
  Therefore,
  \[
    [0; a₁, …, aₙ] = \frac{1}{[a₁; a₂, …, aₙ]} = \frac{1}{a₁ + [0; a₂, …, aₙ]} < 1. \qedhere
  \]
\end{proof}

\iffalse
\begin{figure}[tb]
  \centering
  \includestandalone{figures/golden-rectangle}
  \caption{
    The golden rectangle with side lengths $1$ and $φ$.
    Cutting of one unit square from the rectangle gives another rectangle with lengths $φ - 1$ and $1$.
    The ratio between the longer and shorter side remains the same.
  }
  \label{fig:golden-rectangle}
\end{figure}

\begin{example}
  Consider the golden ratio $φ$.
  It is the positive real root of the polynomial $p(x) = x^2 - x - 1$,
  which means that it satisfies $φ = 1 + 1/φ$.
  Since it is positive, we have $1 < φ = 1 + 1/φ < 2$ and $\floor{φ} = 1$.
  This makes the construction of the continued fraction particularly simple since
  \[
    φ = 1 + \cfrac{1}{1 + \cfrac{1}{1 + \cfrac{1}{⋱}}}.
  \]
  So the golden ratio $φ$ is represented by $[1; \overline{1}]$.
\end{example}

For the golden ratio, there is also a geometric interpretation via the golden
rectangle as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:golden-rectangle}.
The golden rectangle has side lengths of $1$ and $φ$,
and the Euclidean algorithm tries to remove as many unit squares inside the
golden rectangle as possible.
In this case, only one square is removed
and we get a new rectangle with side lengths $1$ and $φ - 1$.
But the ratios between the longer and shorter sides remain the same since
\[
  φ^2 - φ - 1 = 0 ⇔ φ(φ - 1) = 1 ⇔ \frac{φ}{1} = \frac{1}{φ - 1}.
\]
Therefore, in the next rectangle only one square of length $φ - 1$ will be
removed again.
\fi

% TODO: Explain that we need to show that it converges
By definition,
a number $x ∈ ℝ$ can be represented by a continued fraction $[a₀; a₁, …]$
if and only if
\[
  x = \lim_{n → ∞} [a₀; a₁, …, aₙ].
\]
In other words, the convergents must approach the number $x$ as $n$ increases.
Thus, the next step is a proof that convergents actually approach the number $x$.
The first step towards this proof will be the following lemma:

\begin{lemma}
  \label{lem:cf-det}
  $p_{n-1} q_{n-2} - q_{n-1} p_{n-2} = (-1)^n$ for $n ≥ -1$.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
  For $n = 0$, we have
  \[
    p_{-1} q_{-2} - q_{-1} p_{-2} = 1 - 0 = 1.
  \]
  Suppose that the lemma holds for $n ≥ -1$, then
  \begin{align*}
    p_n q_{n-1} - q_n p_{n-1}
    & = (p_{n-1} a_n + p_{n-2}) q_{n-1} - (q_{n-1} a_n + q_{n-2}) p_{n-1} \\
    & = p_{n-2} q_{n-1} - q_{n-2} p_{n-1} \\
    & = (-1) (p_{n-1} q_{n-2} - q_{n-1} p_{n-2}) \\
    & = (-1)^{n+1}. \qedhere
  \end{align*}
\end{proof}

The lemma already gives us a hint towards the convergence of continued fractions,
because dividing the equation by $q_n q_{n-1}$ results in
\[
  \frac{p_n}{q_n} - \frac{p_{n-1}}{q_{n-1}} = \frac{(-1)^{n+1}}{q_n q_{n-1}}.
\]
Since $aₙ > 0$ for $n ≥ 1$, the denominators $q_n$ and $q_{n-1}$ are always
increasing after some point.
Consequently, the distance between consecutive convergents is decreasing.
But we need to show that the convergents actually approach the represented number.
For the proof, we use the fact that the algorithm always guarantees $xₙ - aₙ < 1$.

\begin{lemma}
  \label{lem:cf-approx}
  Let $x ∈ ℝ$ and let $[a₀; a₁, …]$ be the continued fraction constructed using the algorithm from Listing~\ref{lst:cont-frac}.
  If $pₙ/qₙ$ is the $n$-th convergent of the continued fraction, then
  \[
    \left| x - \frac{pₙ}{qₙ} \right| < \frac{1}{qₙ^2}.
  \]
\end{lemma}

% TODO: Have we proven that (p_{n-1} q_n - p_n q_{n-1}) = (-1)^n yet?
\begin{proof}
  Let $x_n = [a_n; a_{n+1}, …]$.
  Then, $x = [a₀; a₁, …, a_{n-1}, x_n]$ and $a_n = \floor{x_n}$.
  Using Lemma~\ref{lem:cf-wallis},
  we can represent $x$ as well as $p_n/q_n$ using the previous convergents
  $p_{n-1}/q_{n-1}$ and $p_{n-2}/q_{n-2}$ together with the coefficients $x_n$
  and $a_n$, respectively.
  Hence,
  \begin{align*}
    \left| x - \frac{pₙ}{qₙ} \right|
    & = \left| \frac{x_n p_{n-1} + p_{n-2}}{x_n q_{n-1} + q_{n-2}} - \frac{a_n p_{n-1} + p_{n-2}}{a_n q_{n-1} + q_{n-2}} \right| \\
    & = \left| \frac{(x_n p_{n-1} + p_{n-2})(a_n q_{n-1} + q_{n-2}) - (x_n q_{n-1} + q_{n-2})(a_n p_{n-1} + p_{n-2})}{(x_n q_{n-1} + q_{n-2})(a_n q_{n-1} + q_{n-2})} \right| \\
    & = \left| \frac{(p_{n-1} q_{n-2} - q_{n-1} p_{n-2})(x_n - a_n)}{((x_n - a_n) q_{n-1} + q_n) q_n} \right|.
  \end{align*}
  From Lemma~\ref{lem:cf-det} it follows that
  \begin{align*}
    \left| x - \frac{pₙ}{qₙ} \right|
    & = \Biggl| \frac{(-1)^{n+1} \overbrace{(x_n - a_n)}^{≤ 1}}{q_n^2 + \underbrace{(x_n - a_n)}_{≥ 0} q_{n-1} q_n} \Biggr| < \frac{1}{q_n^2}. \qedhere
  \end{align*}
\end{proof}

We now have a continued fraction for both rational number and irrational numbers.
What remains to be shown is that the continued fractions are unique.
This would give us a representation for every real number $x ∈ ℝ$ using a
continued fraction $[a₀; a₁, …]$, which is constructed using a version of the
Euclidean algorithm.

\begin{theorem}
  \label{thm:irrat-cf}
  Every real number $x$ has a unique continued fraction.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
  From the previous considerations, it follows that for every number $x ∈ ℝ$,
  there exists a continued fraction $[a₀; a₁, …]$ such that $[a₀; a₁, …] = x$.
  Suppose there is a different continued fraction $[b₀; b₁, …]$ with $[b₀; b₁, …] = x$.
  Because $[0; a₁, a₂, …]$ and $[0; b₁, b₂, …]$ both lie between $0$ and $1$,
  the continued fractions must share the same first coefficient $a₀ = b₀$.
  Otherwise, they would not have the same integer part and represent different numbers.
  By induction, suppose that the first $n ≥ 0$ terms are equal.
  Then, the continued fractions $[a_{n+1}; a_{n+2}, …]$ and $[b_{n+1}; b_{n+2}, …]$ must be equal.
  But by the same argument, we have $a_{n+1} = b_{n+1}$.
  Therefore, the continued fraction $[a₀; a₁, …]$ is unique.
\end{proof}

This concludes the first part for Hermite's question.
We now have a representation of the real numbers using continued fractions.
The second part is about periodic continued fractions and quadratic irrationals.
But before we look into that, we will look into the geometry behind the continued fractions
to understand them better.
The geometrical view will also be useful for the second part of Hermite's question.

% ==============================================================================
\section{Geometrical Interpretation Using Klein Polygons}
% ==============================================================================

The geometry of continued fraction was first analyzed by Klein \cite{Klein95}.
He viewed the convergents $p_n/q_n$ of a continued fraction $[a₀; a₁, …]$ not
as rational numbers lying on a one-dimensional number line,
but as a convergent \emph{vector} $bₙ = (pₙ, qₙ)$ in the two-dimensional integer lattice $ℤ^2$.
Klein has shown many geometrical analogues of important theorems for continued fraction
using these vectors.
However, we will focus on a small subset, which will be useful for the
continued fractions of quadratic irrationals.

\begin{figure}[tb]
  \centering
  \includestandalone{figures/klein-polygon}
  \caption{
    The convergents $pₙ/qₙ$ of $\sqrt{2}$ as vectors $bₙ = (pₙ, qₙ)^⊤$.
    The even and odd convergents form two different polygonal chains which
    approach the irrational line given by $x/y = \sqrt{2}$.
  }
  \label{fig:klein-polygon}
\end{figure}

Figure~\ref{fig:klein-polygon} shows an example with $\sqrt{2}$ and its convergent vectors $bₙ$.
The figure clearly shows that there are two different polygonal chains.
One formed by the even convergents and one formed by the odd convergents.
These chains both seemingly approach a line where $x/y = \sqrt{2}$.
The reason for this follows from the convergence of continued fractions proven in Lemma~\ref{lem:cf-approx}.
If we scale down each convergent $(pₙ, qₙ)$ by its second coordinate,
then we get the vector $(pₙ/qₙ, 1)$.
This vector cannot be further away than $1/qₙ^2$ from the vector $(\sqrt{2}, 1)$.
Therefore, scaling things back up results in a distance $1/qₙ$, which decreases as $n$ increases.
So convergence in this geometrical interpretation means that the vectors are
approaching a line spanned by the vector $(x, 1)$.

Convergence is one property which can be interpreted geometrically.
There is also a geometrical interpretation for the definition of continued fractions themselves.
Suppose we have the vector $\tilde b_{n-1} = (\tilde p_{n-1}, \tilde q_{n-1})^⊤$
for the continued fraction $[a₁; a₂, …, aₙ]$.
To calculate the convergent of $[a₀; a₁, …, aₙ]$,
we would calculate the reciprocal of $\tilde p_{n-1} / \tilde q_{n-1}$ first
and then add the integer part $a₀$ to it.
The equivalent of calculating the reciprocal in the vector space is swapping the two coordinates
since $\tilde b_{n-1} = (\tilde p_{n-1}, \tilde q_{n-1})^⊤$ is the vector for $\tilde p_{n-1} / \tilde q_{n-1}$
and therefore $(\tilde q_{n-1}, \tilde p_{n-1})^⊤$ must be the vector for $\tilde q_{n-1} / \tilde p_{n-1}$.
The second part is adding some integer part $a₀$ to the reciprocal.
This is equivalent to adding $a₀ q$ to the first coordinates
or skewing the vector using linear transformation $S$.
In fact, the reciprocal can also be done by a matrix transformation $R$.
These matrices are defined as follows:
\[
  S^a =
  \begin{pmatrix}
    1 & 1 \\
    0 & 1 \\
  \end{pmatrix}^a
  =
  \begin{pmatrix}
    1 & a \\
    0 & 1 \\
  \end{pmatrix},
  \quad
  R =
  \begin{pmatrix}
    0 & 1 \\
    1 & 0 \\
  \end{pmatrix}.
\]
The vector $b_n$ can then be calculated using
\[
  b_n = S^{a_0} R \tilde b_{n-1}.
\]

For the continued fractions, we quickly moved from the definition to Lemma~\ref{lem:cf-wallis},
which tells us how to calculate the convergent $pₙ/qₙ$ using $p_{n-1}/q_{n-1}$ and $p_{n-2}/q_{n-2}$.
Naturally, we can ask whether this has a nice geometrical interpretation, too.
First, we can easily derive a formula to calculate the vector $bₙ$, since
\begin{align*}
  b_n =
  \begin{pmatrix}
    p_n \\ q_n
  \end{pmatrix}
  =
  \begin{pmatrix}
    p_{n-1} a_n + p_{n-2} \\ q_{n-1} a_n + q_{n-2}
  \end{pmatrix}
  =
  \begin{pmatrix}
    p_{n-1} \\ q_{n-1}
  \end{pmatrix}
  a_n
  +
  \begin{pmatrix}
    p_{n-2} \\ q_{n-2}
  \end{pmatrix}
  = b_{n-1} a_n + b_{n-2}.
\end{align*}
However, there is also an explanation for the choice of the coefficients $aₙ$.
If we view $aₙ$ as a variable between $0$ and infinity, then this forms a ray
starting at $b_{n-2}$ and going in the direction of $b_{n-1}$.
This line must intersect the line spanned by $(x, 1)$ at some point
and we choose $aₙ$ such that $bₙ$ comes just before the intersection.
Importantly, we can use the complete quotient $xₙ$ to calculate the intersection point:
\[
  λ
  \begin{pmatrix}
    x \\
    1 \\
  \end{pmatrix}
  =
  b_{n-1} x_n + b_{n-2}
  \iff
  \frac{λ x}{λ} = \frac{p_{n-1} x_n + p_{n-2}}{q_{n-1} x_n + q_{n-2}}.
\]

For the first new lemma, we return to what we saw in
Figure~\ref{fig:klein-polygon} and show that even and odd convergent lie on
different sides of the line spanned by $(x, 1)$.
In terms of rational numbers,
this means that the convergents alternate between being less than $x$ and being
greater than $x$.

\begin{lemma}
  \label{lem:klein-conv}
  Even and odd convergent lie on different sides of the line spanned by $(x, 1)$.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
  We proceed via induction on $n$.
  For the first two vectors $b_{-2}$ and $b_{-1}$, this is obviously true.
  Now suppose, that $b_{n-1}$ and $b_{n-2}$ lie in different cones.
  The next vector $b_n$ can be calculated according to
  \[
    b_n = b_{n-1} a_n + b_{n-2}.
  \]
  Furthermore, we can find an intersection with the line spanned $(x, 1)$ using
  the complete quotient $xₙ$ of $x$:
  \[
    λ
    \begin{pmatrix}
      x \\
      1 \\
    \end{pmatrix}
    = b_{n-1} xₙ + b_{n-2}.
  \]
  By the induction hypothesis, the vector $b_{n-2}$ is on a different side than $b_{n-1}$.
  However, $a_n$ is smaller than $x_n$, so $b_n = b_{n-1} a_n + b_{n-2}$ never crosses the line.
  Therefore, $b_n$ is on the same side as $b_{n-2}$.
\end{proof}

If we combine the previous two vectors in a matrix $B_n = \begin{pmatrix}
  b_{n-1} & b_{n-2} \\
\end{pmatrix}$,
then we can calculate the next matrix by multiplying with the matrices $S$ and $R$, since
\[
  B_n S^{a_n} R =
  \begin{pmatrix}
    p_{n-1} & p_{n-2} \\
    q_{n-1} & q_{n-2} \\
  \end{pmatrix}
  \begin{pmatrix}
    a_n & 1 \\
    1   & 0 \\
  \end{pmatrix}
  =
  \begin{pmatrix}
    p_{n-1} a_n + p_{n-2} & p_{n-1} \\
    q_{n-1} a_n + q_{n-2} & q_{n-1} \\
  \end{pmatrix}
  =
  B_n.
\]
Since $\det(S^a) = \det(S)^a = 1$ and $\det(R) = -1$, it is straightforward to
see that $B_n$ always has determinant $±1$.
Geometrically, this means that there is no integer point inside the
parallelogram spanned by $b_{n-1}$ and $b_{n-2}$.
This is the geometrical analogue of Lemma~\ref{lem:cf-det},
because $\det(B_n) = p_{n-1} q_{n-2} - p_{n-2} q_{n-1}$.

\begin{lemma}
  \label{lem:klein-empty}
  Between the polygonal chains of the even and odd convergent vectors,
  there exists no nonzero integer point.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
  We can cover the area between the chains
  using parallelograms made up of the points $b_n$, $b_{n-1}, b_{n-2}$, and a suitable fourth point.
  Each parallelogram contains exactly
  \begin{align*}
    |\det\begin{pmatrix}
      b_n - b_{n-2} & b_{n-1} - b_{n-2}
    \end{pmatrix}|
    & = |\det\begin{pmatrix}
      a_n b_{n-1} & b_{n-1} - b_{n-2}
    \end{pmatrix}| \\
    & = |\det\begin{pmatrix}
      a_n b_{n-1} & -b_{n-2}
    \end{pmatrix}| \\
    & = a_n
  \end{align*}
  integer points.
  However, these points all lie on the line between $b_n$ and $b_{n-2}$.
  Therefore, the area between the chains cannot contain any integer point.
\end{proof}

\begin{definition}
  \label{def:klein-polygon}
  Let $v₁, v₂ ∈ ℝ^2$ be two linearly independent vectors.
  Consider the cone $C$ in $ℝ^2$ bounded by the two rays of $v₁, v₂$. That is
  \[
    C = \{ λ₁ v₁ + λ₂ v₂ \mid λ₁, λ₂ ≥ 0 \}.
  \]
  The \emph{Klein polygon} $K$ spanned by $v₁, v₂$ is defined as the convex hull
  of all nonzero integer points inside the cone, i.e.
  \[
    K = \mathrm{conv}(C ∩ ℤ^2 \setminus \{(0, 0)\}).
  \]
  The boundary of such a polygon is denoted as $Π(K)$.
\end{definition}

The even and odd convergent vectors are part of two such Klein polygons.
The even convergents are part of the Klein polygon $K_0$ spanned by $(0, 1)$ and $(x, 1)$,
and the odd convergents are part of the Klein polygon $K_1$ spanned by $(x, 1)$ and $(1, 0)$.
This is shown in the following theorem.

\begin{theorem}
  The Klein polygons $K_0$ and $K_1$ are equal to the
  convex hull of the even and odd convergents, respectively.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
  Suppose there is a point in the Klein polygons,
  which is not in the convex hull of either the even or odd convergents.
  This means that the point must lie between the two polygonal chains,
  which is impossible by Lemma~\ref{lem:klein-empty}.
  Now suppose there is a point in the convex hull of the convergents,
  but not in one of the Klein polygons.
  Then, there must be one convergent outside the Klein polygon,
  which is closer to the line $(x, 1)$.
  However, this integer point is still inside the cone,
  so it is also contained in the Klein polygon.
\end{proof}

\begin{corollary}
  The vertices of $K_0$ and $K_1$ are equal to the
  even and odd convergents, respectively.
\end{corollary}

\section{Quadratic Irrationals and Periodicity}
% ==============================================================================

% TODO: Write introduction for this section
This section is about the second part of Hermite's question for quadratic
irrationals, i.e. whether the continued fraction of a number is periodic if and only
if the number is a quadratic irrational.
Formally, we call a continued fraction $[a₀; a₁, …]$ \emph{periodic}
if there exists a starting index $k₀ ≥ 0$ and a period $ℓ ≥ 1$ such that $aₖ = a_{k+ℓ}$ for every $k ≥ k₀$.
A continued fraction is called \emph{purely periodic} if $k₀ = 0$,
i.e. the period starts immediately.
For a periodic continued fraction starting at $K$ with length $ℓ$,
we will denote it as $[a₀; a₁, …, a_{k₀-1}, \overline{a_{k₀}, …, a_{k₀+ℓ}}]$.
This is similar to how in decimal notation, we denote a period with a bar over the digits,
e.g. $1/3 = 0.\overline{3}$.
In a continued fraction, we similarly denote the period with a line over the
coefficients that are infinitely repeated.

\begin{example}
  We construct the continued fraction for $x = \sqrt{2}$.
  Because it lies between $1$ and $2$, the first term must be $a₀ = 1$.
  The next complete quotient is
  \[
    x₁ = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2} - 1} = \frac{\sqrt{2} + 1}{(\sqrt{2} - 1)(\sqrt{2} + 1)} = \sqrt{2} + 1.
  \]
  It lies between $2$ and $3$,
  so the next term is $a₁ = 2$.
  However, the next complete quotient is the same, since
  \[
    x₂ = \frac{1}{x₁ - 2} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2} - 1} = \sqrt{2} + 1 = x₁.
  \]
  Therefore, terms will repeat and the resulting continued fraction for $\sqrt{2}$ is $[1; \overline{2}]$.
\end{example}

For the proof, we have to show two directions.
The first is that every periodic continued fraction is a quadratic irrational
and the second is that every quadratic irrational has a periodic continued fraction.
We begin with the former and we will use the geometry from the previous section
in the proof.

\begin{theorem}
  If the continued fraction of $x ∈ ℝ$ is periodic, then $x$ is a quadratic irrational.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
  Let $x$ be a purely periodic continued fraction $[a₀; a₁, …]$.
  Then, there exists a complete quotient such that $x = x_ℓ = [a_ℓ; a_{ℓ+1}, …]$ for some $ℓ ≥ 1$.
  For each pair of convergent vectors $b_{n-1}, b_{n-2}$, we can use the
  complete quotient $x_ℓ$ to find an intersection point with the line $(x, 1)$
  and since $x_ℓ = x$, we can also use $x$ itself.
  Stated differently, there exists a scalar $λ ∈ ℝ$ such that
  \[
    B_ℓ
    \begin{pmatrix}
      x \\
      1 \\
    \end{pmatrix}
    =
    b_{ℓ-1} x + b_{ℓ-2}
    = λ
    \begin{pmatrix}
      x \\
      1 \\
    \end{pmatrix}
  \]
  Therefore, $(x, 1)^⊤$ is an eigenvector of the matrix $B_ℓ$
  and $λ$ is the eigenvalue.
  Because $B$ is a 2-by-2 matrix,
  the eigenvalue can only be a quadratic irrational.
  The eigenvector is a solution to the linear system $(B_ℓ - λ I) (x, 1)^⊤ = 0$,
  where the coefficients come from the field $ℚ(λ)$.
  Therefore, $x$ must be a quadratic irrational.

  We proceed with the eventually-periodic case.
  Suppose $x$ is periodic only after some index $k ≥ 0$,
  then $xₖ = [a_k; a_{k+1}, …]$ is a quadratic irrational.
  By Lemma~\ref{lem:cf-wallis},
  \[
    x = \frac{p_{k-1} x_k + p_{k-2}}{q_{k-1} x_k + q_{k-2}}.
  \]
  Because $x$ is a rational expression of $x_k$ with integer coefficients,
  it lives in the same field as $x_k$.
  Therefore, $x$ is a quadratic irrational, too.
\end{proof}

% TODO: Figure for shift of Klein polygon
The converse was originally proven by Lagrange \cite{Lagrange70}.
Here, a proof by Korkina \cite{Korkina96} is presented,
which uses the geometrical interpretation of Klein to show periodicity.
The idea is that for quadratic irrationals,
there always exists a matrix $U$ which shifts the boundary of a Klein polygon
in the positive direction and preserves volume.
Because the volume between two vectors $b_n, b_{n-2}$ directly corresponds to
the coefficients $a_0, a_1, …$, they must repeat at some point.

The first task is to show that such a matrix actually exists.
We show this by interpreting the convergent vectors as members of the
quadratic field $ℚ(x)$.
The number $x$ is a quadratic irrational, so $ℚ(x)$ is isomorphic to a
two-dimensional vector space.
Each vector $b_n$ then has an associated multiplication matrix $M_n$,
where determinant of this matrix defines the algebraic norm $N(pₙ + qₙ x)$.
We show that this norm is bounded independently of $n$.

\begin{lemma}
  The norm $N(p_n + q_n x)$ is bounded by some constant $c$.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
  Suppose $x$ satisfies the equation $Ax^2 + Bx + C = 0$ with $A, B, C ∈ ℤ$,
  then any element $p + qx ∈ ℚ(x)$ has the algebraic norm
  \[
    N(p + qx) = Ap^2 + Bpq + Cq^2.
  \]
  By Lemma~\ref{lem:cf-approx}, the convergent approximates $x$ by a ratio of $1/qₙ^2$.
  Hence, there exists some number $δₙ ∈ ℝ$ with $|δₙ| < 1$ such that $pₙ = qₙ x + \frac{δₙ}{qₙ}$.
  We use this to bound the norm:
  \begin{align*}
    |N(p_n + q_n x)|
    & = |A pₙ^2 + B pₙ qₙ + C qₙ^2| \\
    & = \left|A \left(qₙ x + \frac{δₙ}{qₙ} \right)^2 + B \left(qₙ x + \frac{δₙ}{qₙ} \right) + C qₙ^2\right| \\
    & = \left|\underbrace{(Ax^2 + Bx + C)}_{= 0} qₙ^2 + 2 A δₙ x + B \frac{δₙ}{qₙ} + A \frac{δₙ^2}{qₙ^2} \right| \\
    & \le (2|x| + 1)|A| + |B|. \qedhere
  \end{align*}
\end{proof}

From the lemma, it follows that there must be two different convergent vectors
$b_n, b_m$, whose corresponding elements $p_n + q_n x$ and $p_m + q_m x$ have the same norm.
However, they are not the same, so there must be some number $ε ≠ 1$ in the field
$ℚ(x)$ with $N(ε) = 1$ such that
\[
  ε · (p_n + q_n x) = p_m + q_m x.
\]
The number $ε$ must have a multiplication matrix fundamentally different from
the identity matrix, but it still has determinant $1$.
Such a number is called a \emph{fundamental unit}
and quadratic fields always have a fundamental unit.
An immediate consequence of this is the following lemma:

\begin{lemma}
  For every quadratic irrational $x$, there exists an integer matrix $U ≠ I$
  with determinant $1$, which has eigenvectors $(x, 1)$ and $(\overline{x}, 1)$.
\end{lemma}

\begin{figure}[tb]
  \centering
  \includestandalone{figures/full-klein-polygon}
  \caption{
    The four Klein polygons spanned by $±(\sqrt{2}, 1)$ and $±(-\sqrt{2}, 1)$.
  }
  \label{fig:full-klein-polygon}
\end{figure}

For the proof, we not only consider the Klein polygon in the positive quadrant,
but in all four quadrants.
Instead of the vectors $(1, 0)$ and $(0, 1)$, we use the conjugate
$\overline{x}$ and the vector $(\overline{x}, 1)$.
There are now four different Klein polygons each spanned by $±(x, 1)$
and $±(-\overline{x}, 1)$.
An example is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:full-klein-polygon}.
The idea behind the proof is that the matrix $U$ does not change any of the four
Klein polygons, but it is not the identity and therefore it must move the
points along the boundary.

\begin{theorem}
  If $x$ is a quadratic irrational,
  then its continued fraction is periodic.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
  For any quadratic irrational $x$ with conjugate $\overline{x}$, we can find a
  unimodular matrix $U$ which has $(x, 1)^⊤$ and $(\overline{x}, 1)^⊤$ as eigenvectors.
  Applying $U$ on the Klein polygon, we have
  \begin{align*}
    UK
    = U \mathrm{conv}(C ∩ ℤ^2 \setminus \{(0, 0)\})
    = \mathrm{conv}(UC ∩ Uℤ^2 \setminus \{(0, 0)\}).
  \end{align*}
  The matrix $U$ is unimodular, so $Uℤ^2 = ℤ^2$ by Lemma~\ref{lem:unimodular}.
  Let $v ∈ C$.
  By definition of $C$,
  there exist coefficients $c₁, c₂ ≥ 0$ such that $v = c₁ (x, 1)^⊤ + c₂ (\overline{x}, 1)^⊤$.
  Because the vectors of $C$ are eigenvectors of $U$, we have
  \begin{align*}
    U v
    = c₁
    U\begin{pmatrix}
      x \\
      1 \\
    \end{pmatrix}
    +
    c₂ U\begin{pmatrix}
      x \\
      1 \\
    \end{pmatrix}
    = c₁ λ₁ \begin{pmatrix}
      x \\
      1 \\
    \end{pmatrix}
    + c₂ λ₂ \begin{pmatrix}
      x \\
      1 \\
    \end{pmatrix}
  \end{align*}
  Furthermore, the eigenvalues are positive.
  Thus, $UC = C$ and $K$ must be invariant under $U$.

  Similarly, the boundary $Π(K)$ must also be invariant under this transformation.
  Because $U$ is a linear transformation which preserves the orientation of
  vectors and is not the identity, it must shift the integer points along the
  boundary.
  We assume that it shifts it in the positive direction,
  i.e. $B_{n+k} = U B_n$ for some $k ≥ 1$.
  If not, then we can choose $U^{-1}$ to shift them in the positive direction.
  Because $\det(U) = 1$, the matrix also preserves volume and
  \[
    a_{n+k}
    = \det\begin{pmatrix}
      b_{n+k} & b_{n+k-2}
    \end{pmatrix}
    = \det(U) \det\begin{pmatrix}
      b_n & b_{n-2}
    \end{pmatrix}
    = a_n.
  \]
  Hence, the continued fraction is periodic after some point.
\end{proof}

% TODO: Fix this example
\begin{example}
  Consider the matrix $U$ from Example~\ref{ex:sqrt2-unit}.
  As we have seen, $U$ has $(\sqrt{2}, 1)$ and $(-\sqrt{2}, 1)$ as eigenvectors
  and it has determinant $1$.
  Furthermore, the matrix shifts each convergents by two,
  because
  \[
    B_n = B_{n-2} (S^2 R)^2
    \quad
    \text{ and }
    \quad
    SRS^2RS =
    \begin{pmatrix}
      1 & 1 \\
      0 & 1 \\
    \end{pmatrix}
    \begin{pmatrix}
      1 & 0 \\
      2 & 1 \\
    \end{pmatrix}
    \begin{pmatrix}
      1 & 1 \\
      0 & 1 \\
    \end{pmatrix}
    =
    \begin{pmatrix}
      3 & 4 \\
      2 & 3 \\
    \end{pmatrix}
    = U.
  \]
  Therefore, $B_{n+2} = U B_n$.
\end{example}
