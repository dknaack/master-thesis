# This file contains the preperiod and period for the index sequence of cubic
# roots, where the search only considers sequences where the convergent is a
# good simultaneous approximation. Some roots do not have a good approximation
# using the generalized Euclidean algorithm, so they are empty. Other numbers
# have a representation too long, which I was unable to find
